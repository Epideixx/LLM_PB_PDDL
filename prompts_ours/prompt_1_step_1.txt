Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:
[DOMAIN PDDL]

Now, please follow the different steps to provide a deeper understanding of the domain.
