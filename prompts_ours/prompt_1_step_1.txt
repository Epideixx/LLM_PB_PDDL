Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them. Please be sure to respect the order of the arguments. Be careful, you need to look at how the predicates are used in the actions to understand the arguments, and sometimes it may be counter-intuitive.

Here is the domain PDDL:
[DOMAIN PDDL]

Now, please follow the different steps to provide a deeper understanding of the domain.
