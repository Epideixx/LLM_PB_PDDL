Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
[EXAMPLE TEXT PDDL]

Answer:
[EXAMPLE PB PDDL]

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.
- If the domain requires ":typing", it is required and expected to precise the types of the objects, and if it does not require ":typing", you should not put the types, and only write the list of objects.
- Remember that no objects or predicates can simply be named "object".

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:
[PROBLEM NL]
