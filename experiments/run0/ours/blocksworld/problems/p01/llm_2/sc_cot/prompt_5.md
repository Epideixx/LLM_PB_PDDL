Let's break down the provided text to analyze the initial state and the goal state, and then describe each state in natural language.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:
- **b2 is on top of b3.**
- **b3 is on top of b1.**
- **b1 is on the table.**
- **b2 is clear.**
- **Your arm is empty.**

#### Goal State:
- **b2 should be on top of b3.**
- **b3 should be on top of b1.**

### Step 2: Describe States in Natural Language

#### Initial State:
1. **Block b2 is on top of block b3.**
   - This means that b3 is supporting b2.
2. **Block b3 is on top of block b1.**
   - This means that b1 is supporting b3.
3. **Block b1 is on the table.**
   - This means that b1 is directly placed on the table surface.
4. **Block b2 is clear.**
   - This means that there is no block on top of b2.
5. **Your arm is empty.**
   - This means that the robotic arm is not holding any block.

#### Goal State:
1. **Block b2 should be on top of block b3.**
   - This means that in the desired end state, b3 will be supporting b2.
2. **Block b3 should be on top of block b1.**
   - This means that in the desired end state, b1 will be supporting b3.

### Summary in Natural Language

#### Initial State:
- Block b2 is on top of block b3.
- Block b3 is on top of block b1.
- Block b1 is on the table.
- Block b2 is clear (no block on top of it).
- The robotic arm is empty (not holding any block).

#### Goal State:
- Block b2 should be on top of block b3.
- Block b3 should be on top of block b1.

By clearly understanding the initial and goal states in natural language, we can ensure that the problem PDDL accurately represents the scenario and objectives.
