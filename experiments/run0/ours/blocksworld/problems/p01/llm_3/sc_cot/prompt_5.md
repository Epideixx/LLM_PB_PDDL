Sure, let's break down the initial and goal states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

Based on the text, here are the details for the initial and goal states:

**Initial State:**
- b2 is on top of b3.
- b3 is on top of b1.
- b1 is on the table.
- b2 is clear.
- Your arm is empty.

**Goal State:**
- b2 should be on top of b3.
- b3 should be on top of b1.

### Step 2: Describe the States in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
1. **Block b2:** Block b2 is positioned on top of block b3.
2. **Block b3:** Block b3 is positioned on top of block b1.
3. **Block b1:** Block b1 is directly on the table.
4. **Clear Status:** Block b2 is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
5. **Arm Status:** The robot's arm is empty, indicating it is not holding any block.

**Goal State:**
1. **Block b2:** Block b2 should be positioned on top of block b3.
2. **Block b3:** Block b3 should be positioned on top of block b1.

### Summary in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
- Block `b2` is on top of block `b3`.
- Block `b3` is on top of block `b1`.
- Block `b1` is on the table.
- Block `b2` is clear (no block on top of it).
- The robot's arm is empty.

**Goal State:**
- Block `b2` should be on top of block `b3`.
- Block `b3` should be on top of block `b1`.

These descriptions outline the relationships and conditions of the blocks in both the initial and goal states, allowing for a clear understanding of the task at hand.
