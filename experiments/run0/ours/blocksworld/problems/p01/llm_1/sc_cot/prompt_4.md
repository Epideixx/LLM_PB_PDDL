Sure, here are the guidelines for writing a problem PDDL in the given domain:

### Rules for Writing Problem PDDL

1. **Define the Problem Header**:
   - Use the `(define (problem <problem-name>) (:domain <domain-name>))` format.
   - Replace `<problem-name>` with a meaningful problem identifier.
   - Replace `<domain-name>` with the domain name (`blocksworld-4ops` in this case).

2. **Declare Objects**:
   - Use the `(:objects ...)` section to list all objects in the problem.
   - Objects should be listed with their names, separated by spaces.

3. **Define the Initial State**:
   - Use the `(:init ...)` section to describe the initial state of the world.
   - Include all relevant predicates that describe the state of each object or condition.
   - Use predicates like `(clear <block>)`, `(on-table <block>)`, `(arm-empty)`, `(holding <block>)`, and `(on <block1> <block2>)`.

4. **Define the Goal State**:
   - Use the `(:goal ...)` section to specify the desired final condition or state.
   - Use logical connectors like `and` to combine multiple predicates.
   - The goal state should describe the condition that needs to be true for the problem to be considered solved.

5. **Ensure Consistency**:
   - The initial state should be consistent with the predicates defined in the domain.
   - The goal state should be achievable from the initial state using the actions defined in the domain.

6. **Use Meaningful Names**:
   - Use clear and meaningful names for objects to make the problem easier to understand.

### Example Problem PDDL for the Given Domain

Based on the given problem description:

```plaintext
You have 3 blocks. 
b2 is on top of b3. 
b3 is on top of b1. 
b1 is on the table. 
b2 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b2 should be on top of b3. 
b3 should be on top of b1.
```

Here is the problem PDDL:

```lisp
(define (problem blocksworld-problem)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)

  (:objects
    b1 b2 b3 - block
  )

  (:init
    (on b2 b3)
    (on b3 b1)
    (on-table b1)
    (clear b2)
    (arm-empty)
  )

  (:goal
    (and
      (on b2 b3)
      (on b3 b1)
    )
  )
)
```

### Explanation of the Example:
1. **Problem Header**:
   - The problem is named `blocksworld-problem` and uses the `blocksworld-4ops` domain.

2. **Objects**:
   - Declared three objects: b1, b2, and b3, all of type `block`.

3. **Initial State**:
   - Describes the initial arrangement and conditions of the blocks and the arm.
   - `(on b2 b3)`: b2 is on top of b3.
   - `(on b3 b1)`: b3 is on top of b1.
   - `(on-table b1)`: b1 is on the table.
   - `(clear b2)`: b2 is clear (no block on top of it).
   - `(arm-empty)`: The robotic arm is empty.

4. **Goal State**:
   - Specifies the desired arrangement of the blocks.
   - The goal is to have `(on b2 b3)` and `(on b3 b1)`.

By following these rules and the example structure, you can create a well-defined problem PDDL for the `blocksworld-4ops` domain.
