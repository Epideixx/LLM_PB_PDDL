Sure, let's break down the problem description into initial and goal states, and then explain each state in natural language.

### Step 1: Analyze the States

#### Initial State
From the problem description, the initial state includes:
- b2 is on top of b3.
- b3 is on top of b1.
- b1 is on the table.
- b2 is clear.
- Your arm is empty.

#### Goal State
From the problem description, the goal state includes:
- b2 should be on top of b3.
- b3 should be on top of b1.

### Step 2: Describe the States in Natural Language

#### Initial State Description
1. **b1** is directly on the table. 
2. **b3** is on top of **b1**.
3. **b2** is on top of **b3**.
4. **b2** is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
5. The robotic arm is empty, meaning it is not holding any block.

This can be visualized as:
```
   b2
   b3
   b1
   Table
```

#### Goal State Description
1. **b2** should be on top of **b3**.
2. **b3** should be on top of **b1**.

Since the goal description matches the initial state in this example, the goal can be visualized similarly:
```
   b2
   b3
   b1
   Table
```

### Summary

#### Initial State
- **b1** is on the table.
- **b3** is on top of **b1**.
- **b2** is on top of **b3**.
- **b2** is clear (no block on top of it).
- The robotic arm is empty.

#### Goal State
- **b2** should be on top of **b3**.
- **b3** should be on top of **b1**.

These descriptions provide a clear understanding of the initial configuration and the desired final configuration of the blocks in the given problem.
