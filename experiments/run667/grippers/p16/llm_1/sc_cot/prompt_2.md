Based on the provided text, we can extract the number of objects for each type as follows:

1. **robot**: 4
   - Mentioned explicitly: "You control 4 robots"
   
2. **gripper**: 8
   - Each robot has two grippers: "each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper"
   - Total grippers = 4 robots * 2 grippers per robot = 8 grippers
   
3. **room**: 4
   - Mentioned explicitly: "There are 4 rooms"
   
4. **ball**: 8
   - Mentioned explicitly: "There are 8 balls"

Here is the answer in the required format:

Answer:
```json
{
  "robot": 4,
  "gripper": 8,
  "room": 4,
  "ball": 8
}
```
