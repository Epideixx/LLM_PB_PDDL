Sure, let's break down the initial and goal states based on the provided information. I'll follow the steps as suggested:

### Step 1: Analyzing Initial and Goal States

**Initial State**:
- The locations of robots in specific rooms.
- The locations of balls in specific rooms.
- The state of the robot's grippers (all are free).

**Goal State**:
- The target locations where balls should be moved.

### Step 2: Writing Connections in Natural Language

**Initial State**:

1. **Robot Locations**:
   - `robot1` is located in `room1`.
   - `robot2` is located in `room4`.
   - `robot3` is located in `room3`.
   - `robot4` is located in `room4`.

2. **Ball Locations**:
   - `ball1` is located in `room3`.
   - `ball2` is located in `room3`.
   - `ball3` is located in `room3`.
   - `ball4` is located in `room1`.
   - `ball5` is located in `room4`.
   - `ball6` is located in `room4`.
   - `ball7` is located in `room1`.
   - `ball8` is located in `room1`.

3. **Gripper States**:
   - All grippers (both left and right) of `robot1`, `robot2`, `robot3`, and `robot4` are free.

**Goal State**:

1. **Ball Target Locations**:
   - `ball1` should be moved to `room2`.
   - `ball2` should remain in `room3` (already in its target location).
   - `ball3` should be moved to `room1`.
   - `ball4` should be moved to `room3`.
   - `ball5` should be moved to `room1`.
   - `ball6` should be moved to `room1`.
   - `ball7` should be moved to `room4` (already in its target location).
   - `ball8` should be moved to `room2`.

### Summary in Natural Language:

**Initial State**:
1. `robot1` starts in `room1`.
2. `robot2` starts in `room4`.
3. `robot3` starts in `room3`.
4. `robot4` starts in `room4`.
5. `ball1` starts in `room3`.
6. `ball2` starts in `room3`.
7. `ball3` starts in `room3`.
8. `ball4` starts in `room1`.
9. `ball5` starts in `room4`.
10. `ball6` starts in `room4`.
11. `ball7` starts in `room1`.
12. `ball8` starts in `room1`.
13. All robots have their left and right grippers free.

**Goal State**:
1. `ball1` needs to be moved to `room2`.
2. `ball2` should remain in `room3`.
3. `ball3` needs to be moved to `room1`.
4. `ball4` needs to be moved to `room3`.
5. `ball5` needs to be moved to `room1`.
6. `ball6` needs to be moved to `room1`.
7. `ball7` should remain in `room4`.
8. `ball8` needs to be moved to `room2`.

This summary provides a clear initial state and goal state for the problem, detailing the positions and states of all relevant objects and their relationships.
