Sure, let's break down the provided domain PDDL into the requested information.

### Step 1: Extracting and Describing Types
Below are the types defined in the domain along with their descriptions:

1. **room**: Represents a location or area where actions can take place.
2. **robot**: Represents a robotic entity that performs actions in the environment.
3. **gripper**: Represents a gripping mechanism or tool used by the robot to manipulate objects.
4. **object**: A general category for any item in the environment, including rooms, robots, and grippers.

### Step 2: Extracting and Describing Predicates
Below are the predicates defined in the domain, including the number of arguments, the type of each argument, and a short description:

1. **(at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room)**
   - **Number of Arguments**: 2
   - **Argument Types**: 
     - `?r`: robot
     - `?x`: room
   - **Description**: Indicates that robot `?r` is at room `?x`.

2. **(at ?o - object ?x - room)**
   - **Number of Arguments**: 2
   - **Argument Types**: 
     - `?o`: object
     - `?x`: room
   - **Description**: Indicates that object `?o` is at room `?x`.

3. **(free ?r - robot ?g - gripper)**
   - **Number of Arguments**: 2
   - **Argument Types**: 
     - `?r`: robot
     - `?g`: gripper
   - **Description**: Indicates that gripper `?g` of robot `?r` is free and available for use.

4. **(carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper)**
   - **Number of Arguments**: 3
   - **Argument Types**: 
     - `?r`: robot
     - `?o`: object
     - `?g`: gripper
   - **Description**: Indicates that robot `?r` is carrying object `?o` using gripper `?g`.

By following these steps, we have now a deeper understanding of the types and predicates used in the given domain PDDL.
