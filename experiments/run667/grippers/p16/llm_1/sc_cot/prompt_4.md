Sure, based on the domain and problem provided, here are some rules and constraints that should be followed:

### Domain Constraints and Rules:

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - A robot can only move from one room to another if it is currently in a room.
   - A robot's new location must be a valid room.

2. **Gripper Rules**:
   - Each robot has two grippers (left and right), and each gripper can be either free or holding one ball.
   - A robot can only pick up a ball if at least one of its grippers is free.
   - A robot can only drop a ball if it is currently holding that ball in one of its grippers.

3. **Ball Transport Rules**:
   - Balls should be moved from their current locations to their designated target locations as specified in the problem.
   - A ball can only be picked up if it is in the same room as the robot.
   - A ball can only be dropped in the target room specified.

4. **Initial Conditions**:
   - All robots start in specified rooms.
   - All balls start in specified rooms.
   - All grippers are initially free.

5. **Goal Conditions**:
   - Each ball must be in its specified target room.
   - No robot needs to be in a specific room after transporting the balls.

### Specific Rules from the Problem:

1. **Robot Initial Positions**:
   - `robot1` starts in `room1`.
   - `robot2` starts in `room4`.
   - `robot3` starts in `room3`.
   - `robot4` starts in `room4`.

2. **Ball Initial Positions**:
   - `ball1` starts in `room3`.
   - `ball2` starts in `room3`.
   - `ball3` starts in `room3`.
   - `ball4` starts in `room1`.
   - `ball5` starts in `room4`.
   - `ball6` starts in `room4`.
   - `ball7` starts in `room1`.
   - `ball8` starts in `room1`.

3. **Ball Target Positions**:
   - `ball1` should be moved to `room2`.
   - `ball2` should remain in `room3`.
   - `ball3` should be moved to `room1`.
   - `ball4` should be moved to `room3`.
   - `ball5` should be moved to `room1`.
   - `ball6` should be moved to `room1`.
   - `ball7` should be moved to `room4`.
   - `ball8` should be moved to `room2`.

### Actions:

1. **Move**:
   - **Preconditions**: The robot is currently in the `from` room.
   - **Effects**: The robot is no longer in the `from` room and is now in the `to` room.

2. **Pick**:
   - **Preconditions**: The robot and the ball are in the same room, and the robot has a free gripper.
   - **Effects**: The ball is no longer in the room, and the robot is now carrying the ball with the specified gripper.

3. **Drop**:
   - **Preconditions**: The robot is carrying the ball with its gripper, and the robot is in the target room.
   - **Effects**: The ball is now in the target room, and the robot's gripper is free.

These rules and constraints help ensure that the problem can be formulated and solved within the given domain. They also help in defining the initial state and the goal state clearly, which is essential for creating a valid PDDL problem file.
