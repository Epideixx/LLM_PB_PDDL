Let's follow the steps to clearly explain the initial and goal states.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
The initial state describes the starting conditions of the environment, including the locations of robots and balls, and the status of the grippers.

- The environment has 4 robots, each with a left and a right gripper.
- There are 4 rooms and 8 balls.
- The initial locations of the robots are:
  - robot1 is in room1
  - robot2 is in room4
  - robot3 is in room3
  - robot4 is in room4
- The initial locations of the balls are:
  - ball1 is in room3
  - ball2 is in room3
  - ball3 is in room3
  - ball4 is in room1
  - ball5 is in room4
  - ball6 is in room4
  - ball7 is in room1
  - ball8 is in room1
- All robots' grippers are free.

#### Goal State
The goal state describes the desired conditions of the environment that we aim to achieve.

- The balls should be transported to the following rooms:
  - ball1 should be in room2
  - ball2 should be in room3
  - ball3 should be in room1
  - ball4 should be in room3
  - ball5 should be in room1
  - ball6 should be in room1
  - ball7 should be in room4
  - ball8 should be in room2

### Step 2: Write Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State in Natural Language

- **Robots and Rooms**:
  - robot1 is located in room1.
  - robot2 is located in room4.
  - robot3 is located in room3.
  - robot4 is located in room4.
  
- **Balls and Rooms**:
  - ball1 is located in room3.
  - ball2 is located in room3.
  - ball3 is located in room3.
  - ball4 is located in room1.
  - ball5 is located in room4.
  - ball6 is located in room4.
  - ball7 is located in room1.
  - ball8 is located in room1.

- **Grippers**:
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot1 are free.
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot2 are free.
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot3 are free.
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot4 are free.

#### Goal State in Natural Language

- **Balls and Their Desired Rooms**:
  - ball1 should be located in room2.
  - ball2 should be located in room3.
  - ball3 should be located in room1.
  - ball4 should be located in room3.
  - ball5 should be located in room1.
  - ball6 should be located in room1.
  - ball7 should be located in room4.
  - ball8 should be located in room2.

By clearly defining the initial and goal states in natural language, we can better understand what needs to be achieved and how the objects are related to each other at the start and in the desired end state.
