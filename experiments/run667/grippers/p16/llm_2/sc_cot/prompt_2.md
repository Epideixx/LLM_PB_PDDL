Based on the provided problem description, let's extract the number of objects for each type defined in the domain PDDL.

### Text Analysis:
- **Robots**: 4 robots (robot1, robot2, robot3, robot4)
- Each robot has two grippers: a left gripper and a right gripper.
- **Rooms**: 4 rooms (room1, room2, room3, room4)
- **Balls**: 8 balls (ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5, ball6, ball7, ball8)

### Object Count:
- **robot**: 4
- **gripper**: 8 (2 grippers per robot * 4 robots)
- **room**: 4
- **ball** (which is an object type): 8

### Answer:
```json
{
  "robot": 4,
  "gripper": 8,
  "room": 4,
  "ball": 8
}
```

This provides the number of objects for each type as described in the problem.
