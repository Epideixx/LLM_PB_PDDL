### Explanation

#### Objects
- **Robots**: robot1, robot2, robot3, robot4
- **Grippers**: robot1_left_gripper, robot1_right_gripper, robot2_left_gripper, robot2_right_gripper, robot3_left_gripper, robot3_right_gripper, robot4_left_gripper, robot4_right_gripper
- **Rooms**: room1, room2, room3, room4
- **Balls**: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5, ball6, ball7, ball8

#### Initial State
- **Robot Locations**:
  - robot1 is in room1
  - robot2 is in room4
  - robot3 is in room3
  - robot4 is in room4

- **Ball Locations**:
  - ball1 is in room3
  - ball2 is in room3
  - ball3 is in room3
  - ball4 is in room1
  - ball5 is in room4
  - ball6 is in room4
  - ball7 is in room1
  - ball8 is in room1

- **Gripper States**:
  - All grippers (left and right) of all robots are free.

#### Goal State
- **Desired Ball Locations**:
  - ball1 should be in room2
  - ball2 should be in room3
  - ball3 should be in room1
  - ball4 should be in room3
  - ball5 should be in room1
  - ball6 should be in room1
  - ball7 should be in room4
  - ball8 should be in room2

This PDDL problem definition captures the initial and goal states, as well as the objects involved, and is consistent with the rules and constraints of the provided domain.
