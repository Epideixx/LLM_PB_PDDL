system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain gripper-strips)
 (:requirements :strips :typing) 
 (:types room robot gripper - object) ;Add the modify object to "- object" else issue parser
 (:predicates (at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room)
 	      (at ?o - object ?x - room)
	      (free ?r - robot ?g - gripper)
	      (carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper))

   (:action move
       :parameters  (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
       :precondition (and  (at-robby ?r ?from))
       :effect (and  (at-robby ?r ?to)
		     (not (at-robby ?r ?from))))

   (:action pick
       :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
       :precondition  (and  (at ?obj ?room) (at-robby ?r ?room) (free ?r ?g))
       :effect (and (carry ?r ?obj ?g)
		    (not (at ?obj ?room)) 
		    (not (free ?r ?g))))

   (:action drop
       :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
       :precondition  (and  (carry ?r ?obj ?g) (at-robby ?r ?room))
       :effect (and (at ?obj ?room)
		    (free ?r ?g)
		    (not (carry ?r ?obj ?g)))))

Now, please follow the different steps to provide a deeper understanding of the domain.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Sure, let's break down the provided domain PDDL into the requested steps.

### Step 1: Extracting and Describing Types
The domain PDDL defines the following types:

1. **room**:
   - Short description: Represents a location or area within the environment.
   
2. **robot**:
   - Short description: Represents a robotic agent that can perform actions like moving, picking, and dropping objects.
   
3. **gripper**:
   - Short description: Represents a tool or device attached to a robot, used for gripping or handling objects.
   
4. **object**:
   - Short description: Represents any item or entity that can be manipulated by the robot.

### Step 2: Extracting and Describing Predicates
The domain PDDL defines the following predicates:

1. **(at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room)**
   - Number of arguments: 2
   - Argument types: 
     - ?r: robot
     - ?x: room
   - Short description: Indicates that robot ?r is currently at room ?x.
   
2. **(at ?o - object ?x - room)**
   - Number of arguments: 2
   - Argument types:
     - ?o: object
     - ?x: room
   - Short description: Indicates that object ?o is currently at room ?x.
   
3. **(free ?r - robot ?g - gripper)**
   - Number of arguments: 2
   - Argument types:
     - ?r: robot
     - ?g: gripper
   - Short description: Indicates that the gripper ?g of robot ?r is free and not holding any object.
   
4. **(carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper)**
   - Number of arguments: 3
   - Argument types:
     - ?r: robot
     - ?o: object
     - ?g: gripper
   - Short description: Indicates that robot ?r is carrying object ?o with gripper ?g.

This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the types and predicates defined in the provided domain PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Using your understanding of the domain, you will now have to understand a problem, formulated in natural language, which is associated with the previous domain PDDL. Your first mission is to collect the number of objects for each type. 

To guide you, I will provide you with an example which belongs to another domain.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’table’: 2, ’apple’: 4, ’orange’: 3, ’plate’: 5, ’ball’: 3, ’kid’: 3, ’cell’: 8}

Now it is your turn, for the following problem:
Text:
You control 4 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 4 rooms and 8 balls. 
robot3 is in room3. robot4 is in room4. robot1 is in room1. robot2 is in room4. 
ball3 is in room3. ball4 is in room1. ball2 is in room3. ball5 is in room4. ball7 is in room1. ball6 is in room4. ball1 is in room3. ball8 is in room1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room2. 
ball2 should be in room3. 
ball3 should be in room1. 
ball4 should be in room3. 
ball5 should be in room1. 
ball6 should be in room1. 
ball7 should be in room4. 
ball8 should be in room2. 


Answer:


--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Based on the provided problem description, let's extract the number of objects for each type defined in the domain PDDL.

### Text Analysis:
- **Robots**: 4 robots (robot1, robot2, robot3, robot4)
- Each robot has two grippers: a left gripper and a right gripper.
- **Rooms**: 4 rooms (room1, room2, room3, room4)
- **Balls**: 8 balls (ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5, ball6, ball7, ball8)

### Object Count:
- **robot**: 4
- **gripper**: 8 (2 grippers per robot * 4 robots)
- **room**: 4
- **ball** (which is an object type): 8

### Answer:
```json
{
  "robot": 4,
  "gripper": 8,
  "room": 4,
  "ball": 8
}
```

This provides the number of objects for each type as described in the problem.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you will now have to extract the names of each object. 

To guide you, we will keep the same example as previously. As a reminder, here it is.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’apple’: [’apple1’, ’apple2’], ’orange’: [], ’plate’: [’plate_1’, ’plate_2’, ’plate_3’, ’plate_4’, ’plate_5’], ’table’: [’table1’, ’table2’], ’ball’: [’ball1’, ’ball3’], ’room’: [’hall’], ’kid’: [], ’robot’: [], ’cell’: [’cell_0_1’, ’cell_0_2’, ’cell_1_1’, ’cell_1_2’, ’cell_2_1’, ’cell_2_2’, ’cell_3_1’, ’cell_3_2’]}

Now it is your turn, for our current problem:
Text:
You control 4 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 4 rooms and 8 balls. 
robot3 is in room3. robot4 is in room4. robot1 is in room1. robot2 is in room4. 
ball3 is in room3. ball4 is in room1. ball2 is in room3. ball5 is in room4. ball7 is in room1. ball6 is in room4. ball1 is in room3. ball8 is in room1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room2. 
ball2 should be in room3. 
ball3 should be in room1. 
ball4 should be in room3. 
ball5 should be in room1. 
ball6 should be in room1. 
ball7 should be in room4. 
ball8 should be in room2. 


Answer:

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Based on the problem description, let's extract the names of each object for each type.

### Extracted Object Names:

- **robot**: 
  - Names: robot1, robot2, robot3, robot4

- **gripper**: 
  - Each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. Therefore, we can name them as follows:
    - Names: robot1_left_gripper, robot1_right_gripper, robot2_left_gripper, robot2_right_gripper, robot3_left_gripper, robot3_right_gripper, robot4_left_gripper, robot4_right_gripper

- **room**: 
  - Names: room1, room2, room3, room4

- **ball**: 
  - Names: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5, ball6, ball7, ball8

### Answer:
```json
{
  "robot": ["robot1", "robot2", "robot3", "robot4"],
  "gripper": ["robot1_left_gripper", "robot1_right_gripper", "robot2_left_gripper", "robot2_right_gripper", "robot3_left_gripper", "robot3_right_gripper", "robot4_left_gripper", "robot4_right_gripper"],
  "room": ["room1", "room2", "room3", "room4"],
  "ball": ["ball1", "ball2", "ball3", "ball4", "ball5", "ball6", "ball7", "ball8"]
}
```

This provides the names of each object for the corresponding types described in the problem.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Now you have a better understanding of the domain and the problem we have to deal with, you will have to create and think about rules in this domain, that you should follow.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : To effectively solve problems in this domain, we need to establish a set of rules or constraints that guide the behavior of the robots, their grippers, and the objects they interact with. These rules will ensure that the problem-solving process adheres to the logic and requirements of the domain.

### Rules for the Domain

1. **Robot Movement Rules**:
   - A robot can only be in one room at a time.
   - A robot can only move between rooms if it is currently in a room.
   - Moving a robot updates its location and invalidates its previous location.

2. **Gripper Usage Rules**:
   - Each robot has two grippers: a left gripper and a right gripper.
   - A gripper can only hold one object at a time.
   - A gripper can either be free or holding an object.

3. **Object Manipulation Rules**:
   - An object (ball) can only be held by a robot's gripper if the gripper is free.
   - An object can only be picked up if it is in the same room as the robot.
   - An object can only be dropped if the robot is in the desired room.

4. **Preconditions for Actions**:
   - **Move**: A robot can move from one room to another if it is currently in the starting room.
   - **Pick**: A robot can pick up an object if the object is in the same room, the robot is in the same room, and the gripper intended to hold the object is free.
   - **Drop**: A robot can drop an object if it is holding the object with a gripper and is in the target room.

5. **Effects of Actions**:
   - **Move**: Updates the robot's location to the new room and removes it from the previous room.
   - **Pick**: Marks the object as being carried by the robot's gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.
   - **Drop**: Places the object in the room, marks the gripper as free, and the object is no longer being carried by the gripper.

6. **Goal State Rules**:
   - Each ball should be in its specified destination room as per the goal conditions.
   - No ball should be left in a room other than its destination room unless explicitly required.

### Example Action Rules in PDDL Syntax

Here are the updated action rules in PDDL syntax based on the above constraints:

1. **Move Action**:
   ```lisp
   (:action move
       :parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
       :precondition (and (at-robby ?r ?from))
       :effect (and (at-robby ?r ?to)
                    (not (at-robby ?r ?from))))
   ```

2. **Pick Action**:
   ```lisp
   (:action pick
       :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
       :precondition (and (at ?obj ?room) 
                          (at-robby ?r ?room) 
                          (free ?r ?g))
       :effect (and (carry ?r ?obj ?g)
                    (not (at ?obj ?room)) 
                    (not (free ?r ?g))))
   ```

3. **Drop Action**:
   ```lisp
   (:action drop
       :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
       :precondition (and (carry ?r ?obj ?g) 
                          (at-robby ?r ?room))
       :effect (and (at ?obj ?room)
                    (free ?r ?g)
                    (not (carry ?r ?obj ?g))))
   ```

### General Guidelines

- Ensure that all actions' preconditions are met before execution.
- Always update the state to reflect the effects of actions.
- Avoid conflicts such as two robots trying to pick up the same object simultaneously.
- Follow the sequence of actions that leads towards achieving the goal state while respecting the domain constraints.

By adhering to these rules, we can systematically approach problem-solving in this domain, ensuring that all actions are valid and lead towards the desired goal state.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you now have to explain clearly the initial and goal state. To do so, please follow the next steps.
Step 1. Analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state
Step 2. For each of the states, please write in natural language the connections between the objects. For example if one is on top on the other, or located next to each other, or if an object is free, ...

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Let's follow the steps to clearly explain the initial and goal states.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
The initial state describes the starting conditions of the environment, including the locations of robots and balls, and the status of the grippers.

- The environment has 4 robots, each with a left and a right gripper.
- There are 4 rooms and 8 balls.
- The initial locations of the robots are:
  - robot1 is in room1
  - robot2 is in room4
  - robot3 is in room3
  - robot4 is in room4
- The initial locations of the balls are:
  - ball1 is in room3
  - ball2 is in room3
  - ball3 is in room3
  - ball4 is in room1
  - ball5 is in room4
  - ball6 is in room4
  - ball7 is in room1
  - ball8 is in room1
- All robots' grippers are free.

#### Goal State
The goal state describes the desired conditions of the environment that we aim to achieve.

- The balls should be transported to the following rooms:
  - ball1 should be in room2
  - ball2 should be in room3
  - ball3 should be in room1
  - ball4 should be in room3
  - ball5 should be in room1
  - ball6 should be in room1
  - ball7 should be in room4
  - ball8 should be in room2

### Step 2: Write Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State in Natural Language

- **Robots and Rooms**:
  - robot1 is located in room1.
  - robot2 is located in room4.
  - robot3 is located in room3.
  - robot4 is located in room4.
  
- **Balls and Rooms**:
  - ball1 is located in room3.
  - ball2 is located in room3.
  - ball3 is located in room3.
  - ball4 is located in room1.
  - ball5 is located in room4.
  - ball6 is located in room4.
  - ball7 is located in room1.
  - ball8 is located in room1.

- **Grippers**:
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot1 are free.
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot2 are free.
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot3 are free.
  - All grippers (left and right) of robot4 are free.

#### Goal State in Natural Language

- **Balls and Their Desired Rooms**:
  - ball1 should be located in room2.
  - ball2 should be located in room3.
  - ball3 should be located in room1.
  - ball4 should be located in room3.
  - ball5 should be located in room1.
  - ball6 should be located in room1.
  - ball7 should be located in room4.
  - ball8 should be located in room2.

By clearly defining the initial and goal states in natural language, we can better understand what needs to be achieved and how the objects are related to each other at the start and in the desired end state.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

Answer:
(define (problem log_a) 
   (:domain logistics)
   (:objects o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 o7 o8  ;; objects
            tbos tpgh tla            ;; trucks

            cpgh cbos cla)           ;; cities
   (:init (object o1) (object o2) (object o3) (object o4)
	  (object o5) (object o6) (object o7) (object o8)
	  (truck tbos) (truck tpgh) (truck tla) (airplane p1)
	  (airplane p2) (vehicle tbos) (vehicle tpgh) (vehicle tla)
	  (vehicle p1) (vehicle p2)
	  (airport abos) (airport apgh) (location abos)
	  (location apgh) (location ala) (location lbos) (location lpgh)
	  (location lla) (city cbos) (city cpgh) (city cla)
	  (loc lpgh cpgh) (loc lbos cbos) (loc lla cla) (loc apgh cpgh)
	  (loc abos cbos) (loc ala cla)
	  (at o1 lpgh) (at o2 lpgh) (at o3 lpgh) (at o4 lpgh) (at o5 lbos)
          (at o6 lbos) (at o7 lbos) (at o8 lla ) (at p1 apgh) (at p2 apgh)
          (at tbos lbos) (at tpgh lpgh) (at tla lla))
   
   (:goal (and (at o1 lbos) (at o2 abos) (at o3 lla) (at o4 ala)
	       (at o5 lpgh) (at o6 apgh) (at o7 lpgh) (at o8 lpgh) (not(at p1 apgh)))) ;(not(at tbos lbos)) was added to give an example of "Not"
   )

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:

ball3 is in room3. ball4 is in room1. ball2 is in room3. ball5 is in room4. ball7 is in room1. ball6 is in room4. ball1 is in room3. ball8 is in room1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room2.

This PDDL problem definition captures the initial and goal states, as well as the objects involved, and is consistent with the rules and constraints of the provided domain.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Your task is to evaluate if a given problem PDDL is correct and accurately corresponds to the natural description of it, as well as using the provided domain PDDL. You will provide feedback based on the following questions. Note that feedback is only required if the problem PDDL does not match the provided description of it. If no feedback is required, you will simply write "No feedback required."
1. Are any necessary objects missing?  
2. Are any unnecessary objects included?  
3. Are any objects defined with the wrong type?  
4. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?  
5. Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?  
6. Is anything missing from the goal description?  
7. Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?  
8. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?

To help you better understand what is expected from you, here are three examples. Those are all based on the same domain PDDL and on the same description.

Domain:
(define (domain gripper-strips)
 (:requirements :strips :typing) 
 (:types room robot gripper - object) ;Add the modify object to "- object" else issue parser

Description:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- The airport in Los Angeles has not been declared in the objects, you should declare the object "ala" (at Los Angeles) and you should declare it as an "airport" in the initial conditions as well as a location. 
- The airport at Pittsburgh was declared twice in the initial conditions
- The airport at Pittsburgh (apgh) is wrongly declared at city Los Angeles (cla), and shoudl only be declared at Pittsburgh
- In the goals, there is a mistake about the final location of of package 4 (o4), which should be at Los Angeles airport (ala), and not at Pittsburgh.

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- Only two planes should be declared, not three. Please remove one.
- aphg, corresponding to Pittsburgh airport has not been initialized as an airport, which should be done.
- o6 shoudl be initialized as an object, not as a location.
- The predicate (at p2 ala) is not expected to be in the goal, as it was not demanded in the description of the problem.
