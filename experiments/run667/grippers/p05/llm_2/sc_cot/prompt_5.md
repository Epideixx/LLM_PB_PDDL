### Step 1: Analyzing Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
The initial state describes the configuration and state of all objects at the beginning. Based on the provided problem text, the initial state includes:
- Locations of robots.
- Locations of balls.
- Status of grippers.

#### Goal State
The goal state describes the desired configuration and state of objects that need to be achieved. Based on the problem text, the goal state includes:
- Desired locations of balls.

### Step 2: Describing Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State
1. **Robot Locations**:
   - Robot2 is located in Room1.
   - Robot1 is located in Room2.

2. **Ball Locations**:
   - Ball2 is located in Room1.
   - Ball5 is located in Room1.
   - Ball1 is located in Room1.
   - Ball3 is located in Room1.
   - Ball4 is located in Room1.

3. **Gripper Status**:
   - Both the left and right grippers of Robot1 are free.
   - Both the left and right grippers of Robot2 are free.

#### Goal State
1. **Ball Locations**:
   - Ball1 should be located in Room1.
   - Ball2 should be located in Room1.
   - Ball3 should be located in Room2.
   - Ball4 should be located in Room1.
   - Ball5 should be located in Room1.

### Summary in Natural Language

#### Initial State
- There are two robots:
  - Robot1 is in Room2.
  - Robot2 is in Room1.
- The robots have grippers which are free:
  - Robot1 has a left gripper and a right gripper, both are free.
  - Robot2 has a left gripper and a right gripper, both are free.
- There are five balls:
  - Ball1 is in Room1.
  - Ball2 is in Room1.
  - Ball3 is in Room1.
  - Ball4 is in Room1.
  - Ball5 is in Room1.

#### Goal State
- The balls need to be moved to specific rooms:
  - Ball1 should remain in Room1.
  - Ball2 should remain in Room1.
  - Ball3 should be moved to Room2.
  - Ball4 should remain in Room1.
  - Ball5 should remain in Room1.

By breaking down the initial and goal states in natural language, we create a clear and understandable description of the current configuration and the desired end state of the objects within the domain.
