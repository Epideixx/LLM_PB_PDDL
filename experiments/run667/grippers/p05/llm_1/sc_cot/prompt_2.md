Based on the provided text, here is the count of objects for each type:

1. **robot**: 2 (robot1, robot2)
2. **gripper**: 4 (each robot has a left and a right gripper, so 2 robots * 2 grippers each)
3. **room**: 2 (room1, room2)
4. **ball**: 5 (ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5)

So the final count of objects for each type is:

```json
{
  "robot": 2,
  "gripper": 4,
  "room": 2,
  "ball": 5
}
```
