### Step 1: Analyzing Initial and Goal States

**Initial State:**
- Two robots (robot1 and robot2).
- Each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper, both of which are free.
- Two rooms (room1 and room2).
- Five balls (ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5) located in rooms.
- Specific locations of robots and balls:
  - robot2 is in room1.
  - robot1 is in room2.
  - ball2, ball5, ball1, ball3, and ball4 are all in room1.

**Goal State:**
- The balls need to be transported to specified destination rooms:
  - ball1 should be in room1.
  - ball2 should be in room1.
  - ball3 should be in room2.
  - ball4 should be in room1.
  - ball5 should be in room1.

### Step 2: Describing Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
1. **Robots and Grippers:**
   - robot1 is located in room2.
   - robot2 is located in room1.
   - robot1 has two grippers: left_gripper_robot1 and right_gripper_robot1, both of which are free.
   - robot2 has two grippers: left_gripper_robot2 and right_gripper_robot2, both of which are free.

2. **Rooms and Balls:**
   - room1 contains ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, and ball5.
   - room2 does not contain any balls initially.
   
3. **Connections:**
   - ball1 is in room1.
   - ball2 is in room1.
   - ball3 is in room1.
   - ball4 is in room1.
   - ball5 is in room1.

**Goal State:**
1. **Balls in Destination Rooms:**
   - ball1 should be in room1.
   - ball2 should be in room1.
   - ball3 should be in room2.
   - ball4 should be in room1.
   - ball5 should be in room1.

### Summary of Initial and Goal States

**Initial State:**
- robot1 is in room2, with free left and right grippers.
- robot2 is in room1, with free left and right grippers.
- room1 contains ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, and ball5.
- room2 does not contain any balls initially.

**Goal State:**
- ball1 should be in room1.
- ball2 should be in room1.
- ball3 should be in room2.
- ball4 should be in room1.
- ball5 should be in room1.

These descriptions clearly outline the initial and goal states, providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem setup and the desired outcomes.
