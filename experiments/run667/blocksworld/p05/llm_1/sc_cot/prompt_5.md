Let's break down the given problem into the initial state and goal state by analyzing the text.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial State and Goal State

#### Initial State:
The initial state is described by the following statements:
1. b4 is on top of b1.
2. b2 is on top of b3.
3. b3 is on top of b5.
4. b1 is on top of b2.
5. b5 is on the table.
6. b4 is clear.
7. Your arm is empty.

#### Goal State:
The goal state is described by the following statements:
1. b1 should be on top of b3.
2. b3 should be on top of b5.

### Step 2: Connections Between the Objects

#### Initial State in Natural Language:
1. **b4 is on top of b1.**
   - b1 supports b4.
2. **b2 is on top of b3.**
   - b3 supports b2.
3. **b3 is on top of b5.**
   - b5 supports b3.
4. **b1 is on top of b2.**
   - b2 supports b1.
5. **b5 is on the table.**
   - b5 is directly on the table surface.
6. **b4 is clear.**
   - There is no block on top of b4.
7. **Your arm is empty.**
   - The robotic arm is not holding any block.

#### Goal State in Natural Language:
1. **b1 should be on top of b3.**
   - b3 should support b1.
2. **b3 should be on top of b5.**
   - b5 should support b3.

### Summary of Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:
- b4 is on top of b1 (on b4 b1).
- b1 is on top of b2 (on b1 b2).
- b2 is on top of b3 (on b2 b3).
- b3 is on top of b5 (on b3 b5).
- b5 is on the table (on-table b5).
- b4 is clear (clear b4).
- The robotic arm is empty (arm-empty).

#### Goal State:
- b1 should be on top of b3 (on b1 b3).
- b3 should be on top of b5 (on b3 b5).

This breakdown should provide a clear understanding of the initial and goal states in both natural language and PDDL format.
