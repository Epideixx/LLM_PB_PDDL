Given the understanding of the domain and the problem, let's establish the rules that we need to follow. These rules will help us to frame the PDDL problem and solution properly.

### Rules in the Blocksworld Domain

1. **Clear Block Rule:**
   - A block is clear if and only if there is no other block on top of it.
   - Example: If `clear(b4)`, then there is no block on top of `b4`.

2. **On-Table Rule:**
   - A block is on the table if and only if it is not on top of another block.
   - Example: `on-table(b5)` implies that `b5` is directly on the table.

3. **Arm Empty Rule:**
   - The arm can only hold one block at a time.
   - If the arm is holding a block, it cannot hold another block or be empty.
   - Example: If `(holding b1)`, then `arm-empty` must be false.

4. **Holding Block Rule:**
   - The arm can only hold a block if it is clear.
   - Example: To execute the `pickup` action, the block must be clear and on the table.

5. **Stacking Rule:**
   - To stack a block `A` on another block `B`, `B` must be clear, and `A` must be held by the arm.
   - Example: To execute the `stack` action, `(clear B)` and `(holding A)` must be true.

6. **Unstacking Rule:**
   - To unstack a block `A` from another block `B`, `A` must be clear, and the arm must be empty.
   - Example: To execute the `unstack` action, `(on A B)`, `(clear A)`, and `arm-empty` must be true.

### Actions and Preconditions/Effects

1. **Pickup Action:**
   - Preconditions: The block is clear, on the table, and the arm is empty.
   - Effects: The arm is holding the block, the block is not clear, and the block is no longer on the table, the arm is no longer empty.
   - PDDL Representation:
     ```pddl
     (:action pickup
        :parameters (?ob)
        :precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty))
        :effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (on-table ?ob)) 
                     (not (arm-empty))))
     ```

2. **Putdown Action:**
   - Preconditions: The arm is holding the block.
   - Effects: The block is clear, on the table, the arm is empty, and the block is no longer held by the arm.
   - PDDL Representation:
     ```pddl
     (:action putdown
        :parameters  (?ob)
        :precondition (holding ?ob)
        :effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob) 
                     (not (holding ?ob))))
     ```

3. **Stack Action:**
   - Preconditions: The block to be placed is held by the arm, and the block to place it on is clear.
   - Effects: The arm is empty, the block to be placed is clear, the block to place it on is no longer clear, and the block is stacked on top of the other block.
   - PDDL Representation:
     ```pddl
     (:action stack
        :parameters  (?ob ?underob)
        :precondition (and (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob))
        :effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob)
                     (not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob))))
     ```

4. **Unstack Action:**
   - Preconditions: The block to be picked up is clear, the arm is empty, and the block is on top of another block.
   - Effects: The arm is holding the block, the block below is clear, and the block is no longer stacked on the other block.
   - PDDL Representation:
     ```pddl
     (:action unstack
        :parameters  (?ob ?underob)
        :precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob) (arm-empty))
        :effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob)
                     (not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty))))
     ```

### Summary of Rules

1. **A block can only be picked up if it is clear and on the table, and the arm is empty.**
2. **A block can only be put down if the arm is holding it.**
3. **A block can only be stacked on another block if the block being stacked is held by the arm and the block it is being stacked on is clear.**
4. **A block can only be unstacked from another block if it is clear, the arm is empty, and the block is on top of another block.**

These rules will help in creating a valid PDDL problem instance and formulating the solution.
