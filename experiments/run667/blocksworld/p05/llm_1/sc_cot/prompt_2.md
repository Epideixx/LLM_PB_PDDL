Based on the given problem description, let's extract and count the number of objects for each type.

Text:
You have 5 blocks. 
b4 is on top of b1. 
b2 is on top of b3. 
b3 is on top of b5. 
b1 is on top of b2. 
b5 is on the table. 
b4 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b1 should be on top of b3. 
b3 should be on top of b5. 

Answer:
```json
{'block': 5}
```

Explanation:
- The problem mentions that there are 5 blocks explicitly.
- The domain does not define other types such as tables, plates, apples, or other objects.
- Therefore, the only type we consider here is `block`, and there are 5 of them.
