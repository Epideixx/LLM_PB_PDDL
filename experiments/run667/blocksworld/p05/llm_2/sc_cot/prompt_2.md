Let's analyze the given problem text and count the number of objects for each type.

### Text Analysis:
- "You have 5 blocks."
  - This indicates there are 5 blocks.

Since the problem text only mentions blocks and no other types of objects, we can infer the number of blocks.

### Answer:
```json
{'block': 5}
```

So, based on the given problem description, the only type is `block`, and there are 5 blocks in total.
