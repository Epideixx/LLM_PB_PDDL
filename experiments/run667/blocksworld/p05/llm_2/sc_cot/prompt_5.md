### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State Information:**
- "You have 5 blocks."
- "b4 is on top of b1."
- "b2 is on top of b3."
- "b3 is on top of b5."
- "b1 is on top of b2."
- "b5 is on the table."
- "b4 is clear."
- "Your arm is empty."

**Goal State Information:**
- "b1 should be on top of b3."
- "b3 should be on top of b5."

### Step 2: Write the Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

#### Initial State

1. **Block Connections:**
   - Block `b4` is on top of block `b1`.
   - Block `b2` is on top of block `b3`.
   - Block `b3` is on top of block `b5`.
   - Block `b1` is on top of block `b2`.
   - Block `b5` is on the table.

2. **Block Status:**
   - Block `b4` is clear (no block is on top of it).
   - Block `b1` is not clear (block `b4` is on top of it).
   - Block `b2` is not clear (block `b1` is on top of it).
   - Block `b3` is not clear (block `b2` is on top of it).
   - Block `b5` is not clear (block `b3` is on top of it).

3. **Robotic Arm:**
   - The robotic arm is empty.

#### Goal State

1. **Block Connections:**
   - Block `b1` should be on top of block `b3`.
   - Block `b3` should be on top of block `b5`.

2. **Block Status:**
   - Block `b1` should not be clear (it should be on top of block `b3`).
   - Block `b3` should not be clear (it should be on top of block `b5`).
   - Block `b5` should be clear after being the base for `b3`.

### Summary in Natural Language

#### Initial State
- You have 5 blocks: `b1`, `b2`, `b3`, `b4`, and `b5`.
- Block `b4` is on top of block `b1`.
- Block `b2` is on top of block `b3`.
- Block `b3` is on top of block `b5`.
- Block `b1` is on top of block `b2`.
- Block `b5` is on the table.
- Block `b4` is clear.
- The robotic arm is empty.

#### Goal State
- Block `b1` should be on top of block `b3`.
- Block `b3` should be on top of block `b5`.
- Block `b5` should be clear after being the base for `b3`.
