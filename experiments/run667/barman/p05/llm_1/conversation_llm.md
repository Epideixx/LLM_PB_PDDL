system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain barman)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

This should provide a clearer understanding of the types and predicates used in your domain PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Using your understanding of the domain, you will now have to understand a problem, formulated in natural language, which is associated with the previous domain PDDL. Your first mission is to collect the number of objects for each type. 

To guide you, I will provide you with an example which belongs to another domain.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’table’: 2, ’apple’: 4, ’orange’: 3, ’plate’: 5, ’ball’: 3, ’kid’: 3, ’cell’: 8}

Now it is your turn, for the following problem:
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2. 

Answer:


--------------------------------------------------

assistant : To determine the number of objects for each type based on the provided problem text, we will extract the relevant information and map it to the types defined in the domain PDDL.

**Text Analysis:**

- **Shaker**: 1 shaker
- **Level**: 3 levels (associated with the shaker)
- **Shot Glasses**: 5 shot glasses (equivalent to the 'shot' type)
- **Dispenser**: 3 dispensers
- **Ingredient**: 3 ingredients
- **Cocktail**: 4 cocktails (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)
- **Hand**: 2 hands (left and right)

**Mapped Types and Counts:**

1. **hand**: 2 (left hand, right hand)
2. **level**: 3 (levels for the shaker)
3. **beverage**: Not explicitly mentioned apart from cocktails, but no specific count given for general beverages.
4. **dispenser**: 3
5. **container**: This is a general type that includes specific containers like shots and shakers. No specific count for the general type is needed.
6. **ingredient**: 3
7. **cocktail**: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)
8. **shot**: 5 (shot glasses)
9. **shaker**: 1

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  "hand": 2,
  "level": 3,
  "dispenser": 3,
  "ingredient": 3,
  "cocktail": 4,
  "shot": 5,
  "shaker": 1
}
```

This mapping provides the number of objects for each type as extracted from the problem text.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you will now have to extract the names of each object. 

To guide you, we will keep the same example as previously. As a reminder, here it is.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’apple’: [’apple1’, ’apple2’], ’orange’: [], ’plate’: [’plate_1’, ’plate_2’, ’plate_3’, ’plate_4’, ’plate_5’], ’table’: [’table1’, ’table2’], ’ball’: [’ball1’, ’ball3’], ’room’: [’hall’], ’kid’: [], ’robot’: [], ’cell’: [’cell_0_1’, ’cell_0_2’, ’cell_1_1’, ’cell_1_2’, ’cell_2_1’, ’cell_2_2’, ’cell_3_1’, ’cell_3_2’]}

Now it is your turn, for our current problem:
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2. 

Answer:

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Based on the provided problem text, we need to extract the names of each object. Here is the detailed analysis and extraction:

**Text Analysis and Object Extraction:**

- **Shaker**: 1 shaker (`shaker1`)
- **Level**: 3 levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`)
- **Shot Glasses**: 5 shot glasses (`shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, `shot5`)
- **Dispenser**: 3 dispensers (`dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, `dispenser3`)
- **Ingredient**: 3 ingredients (`ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `ingredient3`)
- **Cocktail**: 4 cocktails (`cocktail1`, `cocktail2`, `cocktail3`, `cocktail4`)
- **Hand**: 2 hands (`left-hand`, `right-hand`)

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  "hand": ["left-hand", "right-hand"],
  "level": ["level1", "level2", "level3"],
  "dispenser": ["dispenser1", "dispenser2", "dispenser3"],
  "ingredient": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
  "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
  "shot": ["shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4", "shot5"],
  "shaker": ["shaker1"]
}
```

This mapping provides the names of each object for the respective types as extracted from the problem text.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Now you have a better understanding of the domain and the problem we have to deal with, you will have to create and think about rules in this domain, that you should follow.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Certainly! Based on the domain and the problem at hand, we need to create a set of rules that guide the actions and interactions in this environment. These rules will help in formulating the problem PDDL and ensure logical consistency. Here are some rules:

### General Rules

1. **Object States**:
    - All containers (including shots and shakers) start in an empty and clean state.
    - Hands start empty.

2. **Shaker Levels**:
    - Shakers have defined levels, and actions involving shakers must respect these levels.
    - Levels must follow a sequential order as specified by the `next` predicate.

3. **Cocktail Ingredients**:
    - Each cocktail has specific ingredients that must be combined in the shaker.
    - Ingredients can be dispensed only from specified dispensers.

### Action Precondition Rules

1. **Grasping and Holding**:
    - A hand can only grasp an object if it is empty (`handempty`).
    - A container can only be grasped if it is on the table (`ontable`).

2. **Filling Shots**:
    - A shot can be filled only if it is empty and clean.
    - Both hands must be involved: one holding the shot and the other operating the dispenser.

3. **Pouring to Shaker**:
    - A shot can only be poured into a shaker if the shot contains an ingredient and the shaker is empty and clean.
    - The shaker level must be updated accordingly.

4. **Shaking**:
    - A shaker must contain all required ingredients for a cocktail before it can be shaken.
    - The shaker must be unshaked before the shaking action.

5. **Pouring from Shaker to Shot**:
    - A cocktail must be fully mixed (shaken) in the shaker before it can be poured into a shot.
    - The shot must be empty and clean before receiving the cocktail.

6. **Cleaning Containers**:
    - Containers can only be cleaned if they are empty and used.

### Action Effect Rules

1. **Grasping**:
    - Grasping an object makes the hand no longer empty and the object no longer on the table.

2. **Leaving**:
    - Leaving an object makes the hand empty and the object placed on the table.

3. **Filling Shots**:
    - Filling a shot will make it no longer empty, no longer clean, and will contain the specified ingredient.

4. **Pouring to Shaker**:
    - Pouring an ingredient from a shot to a shaker will transfer the ingredient, update the levels, and mark the shaker as not clean.

5. **Shaking**:
    - Shaking will combine the ingredients into the specified cocktail, empty the shaker of the ingredients, and mark the shaker as shaken.

6. **Pouring from Shaker to Shot**:
    - Pouring a cocktail from a shaker to a shot will transfer the cocktail, update the levels, and mark the shot as containing the cocktail.

7. **Cleaning Containers**:
    - Cleaning will mark the container as clean and no longer used.

### Goal Rules

1. **Cocktail Creation**:
    - The goal is to make specified cocktails and pour them into the respective shots.
    - Each shot should contain the correct cocktail as specified by the goal description.

By adhering to these rules, we can ensure that the actions taken in the problem domain will be consistent and logical, leading to a correct and achievable goal state.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you now have to explain clearly the initial and goal state. To do so, please follow the next steps.
Step 1. Analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state
Step 2. For each of the states, please write in natural language the connections between the objects. For example if one is on top on the other, or located next to each other, or if an object is free, ...

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Let's break down the initial and goal states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

- **Initial State**:
    - All objects' initial conditions as described in the problem text.
    - The state of various objects (e.g., clean, empty, on table, etc.).
    - The initial associations between objects (e.g., hand states, container states).

- **Goal State**:
    - Desired end conditions as described in the problem text.
    - Specific cocktails must be made and placed in designated shot glasses.

### Step 2: Write in Natural Language the Connections Between the Objects

#### Initial State

1. **Shaker**:
    - `shaker1` is clean.
    - `shaker1` is empty.
    - `shaker1` is on the table.

2. **Shot Glasses**:
    - `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are clean.
    - `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are empty.
    - `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are on the table.

3. **Hands**:
    - `left-hand` is empty.
    - `right-hand` is empty.

4. **Dispenser and Ingredients**:
    - `dispenser1` dispenses `ingredient1`.
    - `dispenser2` dispenses `ingredient2`.
    - `dispenser3` dispenses `ingredient3`.

5. **Cocktail Ingredients**:
    - `cocktail1` requires `ingredient2` (first ingredient) and `ingredient1` (second ingredient).
    - `cocktail2` requires `ingredient1` (first ingredient) and `ingredient2` (second ingredient).
    - `cocktail3` requires `ingredient1` (first ingredient) and `ingredient3` (second ingredient).
    - `cocktail4` requires `ingredient3` (first ingredient) and `ingredient2` (second ingredient).

#### Goal State

1. **Cocktail Placement in Shot Glasses**:
    - `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
    - `shot2` contains `cocktail4`.
    - `shot3` contains `cocktail3`.
    - `shot4` contains `cocktail2`.

### Initial State in Natural Language

- `shaker1` is on the table, clean, and empty.
- `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are on the table, clean, and empty.
- `left-hand` and `right-hand` are empty.
- `dispenser1` dispenses `ingredient1`.
- `dispenser2` dispenses `ingredient2`.
- `dispenser3` dispenses `ingredient3`.
- `cocktail1` requires `ingredient2` first and `ingredient1` second.
- `cocktail2` requires `ingredient1` first and `ingredient2` second.
- `cocktail3` requires `ingredient1` first and `ingredient3` second.
- `cocktail4` requires `ingredient3` first and `ingredient2` second.

### Goal State in Natural Language

- `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
- `shot2` contains `cocktail4`.
- `shot3` contains `cocktail3`.
- `shot4` contains `cocktail2`.

By clearly defining the initial and goal states in natural language, we can ensure that the problem is well understood and can be effectively translated into PDDL for planning.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

Answer:
(define (problem log_a) 
   (:domain logistics)
   (:objects o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 o7 o8  ;; objects

   )

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2.

### Explanation

- **Objects Declaration**: 
    - All relevant objects are declared with their types, including the shaker, levels, shot glasses, dispensers, ingredients, cocktails, and hands.
  
- **Initial State**:
    - All objects are clean, empty, and on the table (for the shaker and shot glasses).
    - Hands are empty.
    - Dispensers are associated with their respective ingredients.
    - Defined the sequential order of levels for the shaker.
    - Specified the ingredients required for each cocktail.

- **Goal State**:
    - Each shot glass must contain the specified cocktail.

This PDDL problem definition sets up the initial conditions and the desired goal, ensuring that the domain's rules and the problem's requirements are met.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Your task is to evaluate if a given problem PDDL is correct and accurately corresponds to the natural description of it, as well as using the provided domain PDDL. You will provide feedback based on the following questions. Note that feedback is only required if the problem PDDL does not match the provided description of it. If no feedback is required, you will simply write "No feedback required."
1. Are any necessary objects missing?  
2. Are any unnecessary objects included?  
3. Are any objects defined with the wrong type?  
4. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?  
5. Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?  
6. Is anything missing from the goal description?  
7. Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?  
8. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?

To help you better understand what is expected from you, here are three examples. Those are all based on the same domain PDDL and on the same description.

Description:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- The airport in Los Angeles has not been declared in the objects, you should declare the object "ala" (at Los Angeles) and you should declare it as an "airport" in the initial conditions as well as a location. 
- The airport at Pittsburgh was declared twice in the initial conditions
- The airport at Pittsburgh (apgh) is wrongly declared at city Los Angeles (cla), and shoudl only be declared at Pittsburgh
- In the goals, there is a mistake about the final location of of package 4 (o4), which should be at Los Angeles airport (ala), and not at Pittsburgh.

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- Only two planes should be declared, not three. Please remove one.
- aphg, corresponding to Pittsburgh airport has not been initialized as an airport, which should be done.
- o6 shoudl be initialized as an object, not as a location.
- The predicate (at p2 ala) is not expected to be in the goal, as it was not demanded in the description of the problem.
