To determine the number of objects for each type based on the provided problem text, we will extract the relevant information and map it to the types defined in the domain PDDL.

**Text Analysis:**

- **Shaker**: 1 shaker
- **Level**: 3 levels (associated with the shaker)
- **Shot Glasses**: 5 shot glasses (equivalent to the 'shot' type)
- **Dispenser**: 3 dispensers
- **Ingredient**: 3 ingredients
- **Cocktail**: 4 cocktails (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)
- **Hand**: 2 hands (left and right)

**Mapped Types and Counts:**

1. **hand**: 2 (left hand, right hand)
2. **level**: 3 (levels for the shaker)
3. **beverage**: Not explicitly mentioned apart from cocktails, but no specific count given for general beverages.
4. **dispenser**: 3
5. **container**: This is a general type that includes specific containers like shots and shakers. No specific count for the general type is needed.
6. **ingredient**: 3
7. **cocktail**: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)
8. **shot**: 5 (shot glasses)
9. **shaker**: 1

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  "hand": 2,
  "level": 3,
  "dispenser": 3,
  "ingredient": 3,
  "cocktail": 4,
  "shot": 5,
  "shaker": 1
}
```

This mapping provides the number of objects for each type as extracted from the problem text.
