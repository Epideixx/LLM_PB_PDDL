Let's break down the initial and goal states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

- **Initial State**:
    - All objects' initial conditions as described in the problem text.
    - The state of various objects (e.g., clean, empty, on table, etc.).
    - The initial associations between objects (e.g., hand states, container states).

- **Goal State**:
    - Desired end conditions as described in the problem text.
    - Specific cocktails must be made and placed in designated shot glasses.

### Step 2: Write in Natural Language the Connections Between the Objects

#### Initial State

1. **Shaker**:
    - `shaker1` is clean.
    - `shaker1` is empty.
    - `shaker1` is on the table.

2. **Shot Glasses**:
    - `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are clean.
    - `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are empty.
    - `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are on the table.

3. **Hands**:
    - `left-hand` is empty.
    - `right-hand` is empty.

4. **Dispenser and Ingredients**:
    - `dispenser1` dispenses `ingredient1`.
    - `dispenser2` dispenses `ingredient2`.
    - `dispenser3` dispenses `ingredient3`.

5. **Cocktail Ingredients**:
    - `cocktail1` requires `ingredient2` (first ingredient) and `ingredient1` (second ingredient).
    - `cocktail2` requires `ingredient1` (first ingredient) and `ingredient2` (second ingredient).
    - `cocktail3` requires `ingredient1` (first ingredient) and `ingredient3` (second ingredient).
    - `cocktail4` requires `ingredient3` (first ingredient) and `ingredient2` (second ingredient).

#### Goal State

1. **Cocktail Placement in Shot Glasses**:
    - `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
    - `shot2` contains `cocktail4`.
    - `shot3` contains `cocktail3`.
    - `shot4` contains `cocktail2`.

### Initial State in Natural Language

- `shaker1` is on the table, clean, and empty.
- `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are on the table, clean, and empty.
- `left-hand` and `right-hand` are empty.
- `dispenser1` dispenses `ingredient1`.
- `dispenser2` dispenses `ingredient2`.
- `dispenser3` dispenses `ingredient3`.
- `cocktail1` requires `ingredient2` first and `ingredient1` second.
- `cocktail2` requires `ingredient1` first and `ingredient2` second.
- `cocktail3` requires `ingredient1` first and `ingredient3` second.
- `cocktail4` requires `ingredient3` first and `ingredient2` second.

### Goal State in Natural Language

- `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
- `shot2` contains `cocktail4`.
- `shot3` contains `cocktail3`.
- `shot4` contains `cocktail2`.

By clearly defining the initial and goal states in natural language, we can ensure that the problem is well understood and can be effectively translated into PDDL for planning.
