Certainly! Based on the domain and the problem at hand, we need to create a set of rules that guide the actions and interactions in this environment. These rules will help in formulating the problem PDDL and ensure logical consistency. Here are some rules:

### General Rules

1. **Object States**:
    - All containers (including shots and shakers) start in an empty and clean state.
    - Hands start empty.

2. **Shaker Levels**:
    - Shakers have defined levels, and actions involving shakers must respect these levels.
    - Levels must follow a sequential order as specified by the `next` predicate.

3. **Cocktail Ingredients**:
    - Each cocktail has specific ingredients that must be combined in the shaker.
    - Ingredients can be dispensed only from specified dispensers.

### Action Precondition Rules

1. **Grasping and Holding**:
    - A hand can only grasp an object if it is empty (`handempty`).
    - A container can only be grasped if it is on the table (`ontable`).

2. **Filling Shots**:
    - A shot can be filled only if it is empty and clean.
    - Both hands must be involved: one holding the shot and the other operating the dispenser.

3. **Pouring to Shaker**:
    - A shot can only be poured into a shaker if the shot contains an ingredient and the shaker is empty and clean.
    - The shaker level must be updated accordingly.

4. **Shaking**:
    - A shaker must contain all required ingredients for a cocktail before it can be shaken.
    - The shaker must be unshaked before the shaking action.

5. **Pouring from Shaker to Shot**:
    - A cocktail must be fully mixed (shaken) in the shaker before it can be poured into a shot.
    - The shot must be empty and clean before receiving the cocktail.

6. **Cleaning Containers**:
    - Containers can only be cleaned if they are empty and used.

### Action Effect Rules

1. **Grasping**:
    - Grasping an object makes the hand no longer empty and the object no longer on the table.

2. **Leaving**:
    - Leaving an object makes the hand empty and the object placed on the table.

3. **Filling Shots**:
    - Filling a shot will make it no longer empty, no longer clean, and will contain the specified ingredient.

4. **Pouring to Shaker**:
    - Pouring an ingredient from a shot to a shaker will transfer the ingredient, update the levels, and mark the shaker as not clean.

5. **Shaking**:
    - Shaking will combine the ingredients into the specified cocktail, empty the shaker of the ingredients, and mark the shaker as shaken.

6. **Pouring from Shaker to Shot**:
    - Pouring a cocktail from a shaker to a shot will transfer the cocktail, update the levels, and mark the shot as containing the cocktail.

7. **Cleaning Containers**:
    - Cleaning will mark the container as clean and no longer used.

### Goal Rules

1. **Cocktail Creation**:
    - The goal is to make specified cocktails and pour them into the respective shots.
    - Each shot should contain the correct cocktail as specified by the goal description.

By adhering to these rules, we can ensure that the actions taken in the problem domain will be consistent and logical, leading to a correct and achievable goal state.
