Sure, let's break down the text to identify the initial and goal states, and then describe them in natural language.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
- Objects and their properties:
  - 1 shaker: clean, empty, on the table
  - 3 levels: associated with the shaker
  - 5 shot glasses: clean, empty, on the table
  - 3 dispensers: each associated with one ingredient
  - 3 ingredients
  - 2 hands: both empty
- Cocktails and their ingredients:
  - cocktail1: ingredient2 and ingredient1
  - cocktail2: ingredient1 and ingredient2
  - cocktail3: ingredient1 and ingredient3
  - cocktail4: ingredient3 and ingredient2

#### Goal State
- Create 4 cocktails and place them in specific shot glasses:
  - shot1 contains cocktail1
  - shot2 contains cocktail4
  - shot3 contains cocktail3
  - shot4 contains cocktail2

### Step 2: Describe Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State

1. **Shaker:**
   - There is one shaker (`shaker1`) which is clean, empty, and located on the table.

2. **Levels:**
   - The shaker has three levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`).

3. **Shot Glasses:**
   - There are five shot glasses (`shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, `shot5`). All of them are clean, empty, and located on the table.

4. **Dispensers and Ingredients:**
   - There are three dispensers (`dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, `dispenser3`), each associated with one of the three ingredients (`ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `ingredient3`).

5. **Hands:**
   - Both the left hand (`left_hand`) and the right hand (`right_hand`) are empty.

6. **Cocktails and Ingredients:**
   - `cocktail1` is made up of `ingredient2` and `ingredient1`.
   - `cocktail2` is made up of `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail3` is made up of `ingredient1` and `ingredient3`.
   - `cocktail4` is made up of `ingredient3` and `ingredient2`.

#### Goal State

1. **Create Cocktails and Place Them in Shot Glasses:**
   - `shot1` should contain `cocktail1` which is made up of `ingredient2` and `ingredient1`.
   - `shot2` should contain `cocktail4` which is made up of `ingredient3` and `ingredient2`.
   - `shot3` should contain `cocktail3` which is made up of `ingredient1` and `ingredient3`.
   - `shot4` should contain `cocktail2` which is made up of `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.

### Summary

#### Initial State:
- Shaker `shaker1` is clean, empty, and on the table.
- The shaker has three levels: `level1`, `level2`, and `level3`.
- Shot glasses `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5` are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Dispensers `dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, and `dispenser3` are available, each dispensing `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, and `ingredient3` respectively.
- Both hands (`left_hand` and `right_hand`) are empty.
- Cocktails are defined as:
  - `cocktail1`: ingredient2 and ingredient1
  - `cocktail2`: ingredient1 and ingredient2
  - `cocktail3`: ingredient1 and ingredient3
  - `cocktail4`: ingredient3 and ingredient2

#### Goal State:
- `shot1` contains `cocktail1` (ingredient2, ingredient1).
- `shot2` contains `cocktail4` (ingredient3, ingredient2).
- `shot3` contains `cocktail3` (ingredient1, ingredient3).
- `shot4` contains `cocktail2` (ingredient1, ingredient2).

This explanation should provide a clear understanding of both the initial and goal states in the context of the "barman" domain.
