No, the two texts do not describe the same problem PDDL. Here are the main differences:

1. **Initial Heights:**
   - In the original description, the initial heights of the positions are not explicitly stated, whereas in the given description, it is mentioned that all positions start with a height of h0.

2. **Height Levels:**
   - The original description mentions that the maximum height of blocks is 4 but does not explicitly define the height levels h0, h1, h2, h3, and h4 as in the given description.

3. **Neighbor Relationships:**
   - The given description includes details about neighboring relationships between positions, which are not mentioned in the original description.

4. **Initial State Details:**
   - The given description includes the initial state of all positions having height h0, which is not mentioned in the original description.

5. **Positional Goals:**
   - The original description specifies that "the heights at the other positions remain unchanged," but it does not explicitly state that these positions should remain at h0, as mentioned in the given description.

6. **Explicit Mention of Heights:**
   - The given description provides a more detailed breakdown of the problem with explicit mentions of height levels and successor relationships, which are not present in the original description.

These differences indicate that the provided description includes additional details and assumptions not present in the original PDDL problem description.
