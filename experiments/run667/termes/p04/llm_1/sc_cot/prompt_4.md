Given the domain and the problem at hand, we can derive several rules that govern the behaviors and constraints of the system. These rules will help in formulating valid actions and ensuring the goals are met within the given constraints. Here's a structured approach to the rules:

### General Rules:

1. **Movement Constraints:**
   - The robot can only move to neighboring positions.
   - Movement is only allowed if the target position is a neighbor of the current position.

2. **Block Placement Constraints:**
   - Blocks can only be placed on positions that are not depots.
   - The height of a position can only be increased if the robot has a block.
   - The robot can only place a block if the new height is the successor of the current height.
   - The robot cannot have an unplaced block at the end.

3. **Height Constraints:**
   - The height at a position can only increase or decrease by 1 unit at a time.
   - A position cannot exceed the maximum height of 4.

4. **Depot Constraints:**
   - The depot is a special position where new blocks can be created or destroyed.
   - The robot can only create or destroy a block at the depot position.

5. **Goal Constraints:**
   - The robot must achieve specific heights at certain positions (e.g., height at pos-2-0 should be 3, height at pos-3-2 should be 4).
   - Heights at other positions must remain unchanged.
   - All blocks must be placed by the end.

### Action-Specific Rules:

1. **Move Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the current position (`at ?from`).
     - The target position must be a neighbor (`NEIGHBOR ?from ?to`).
     - Both the current and target positions must have the same height (`height ?from ?h` and `height ?to ?h`).
   - Effects:
     - The robot is no longer at the current position (`not (at ?from)`).
     - The robot is at the target position (`at ?to`).

2. **Move-Up Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the current position (`at ?from`).
     - The target position must be a neighbor (`NEIGHBOR ?from ?to`).
     - The current position must have height `?hfrom` and the target position must have height `?hto`.
     - The target height must be the successor of the current height (`SUCC ?hto ?hfrom`).
   - Effects:
     - The robot is no longer at the current position (`not (at ?from)`).
     - The robot is at the target position (`at ?to`).

3. **Move-Down Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the current position (`at ?from`).
     - The target position must be a neighbor (`NEIGHBOR ?from ?to`).
     - The current position must have height `?hfrom` and the target position must have height `?hto`.
     - The current height must be the successor of the target height (`SUCC ?hfrom ?hto`).
   - Effects:
     - The robot is no longer at the current position (`not (at ?from)`).
     - The robot is at the target position (`at ?to`).

4. **Place-Block Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the current position (`at ?rpos`).
     - The target position must be a neighbor (`NEIGHBOR ?rpos ?bpos`).
     - Both the current and target positions must have the same initial height (`height ?rpos ?hbefore` and `height ?bpos ?hbefore`).
     - The target height after placing the block must be the successor of the initial height (`SUCC ?hafter ?hbefore`).
     - The robot must have a block (`has-block`).
     - The target position must not be a depot (`not (IS-DEPOT ?bpos)`).
   - Effects:
     - The height of the target position changes to the new height (`height ?bpos ?hafter`).
     - The robot no longer has a block (`not (has-block)`).

5. **Remove-Block Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the current position (`at ?rpos`).
     - The target position must be a neighbor (`NEIGHBOR ?rpos ?bpos`).
     - The current position must have the successor height of the target position (`SUCC ?hbefore ?hafter`).
     - The target position must have the initial height (`height ?bpos ?hbefore`).
     - The robot must not have a block (`not (has-block)`).
   - Effects:
     - The height of the target position changes to the new height (`height ?bpos ?hafter`).
     - The robot gains a block (`has-block`).

6. **Create-Block Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the depot position (`at ?p`).
     - The robot must not have a block (`not (has-block)`).
     - The position must be a depot (`IS-DEPOT ?p`).
   - Effects:
     - The robot gains a block (`has-block`).

7. **Destroy-Block Action:**
   - Preconditions:
     - The robot must be at the depot position (`at ?p`).
     - The robot must have a block (`has-block`).
     - The position must be a depot (`IS-DEPOT ?p`).
   - Effects:
     - The robot no longer has a block (`not (has-block)`).

### Summary:
These rules capture the essential constraints and actions within the domain, ensuring that the robot's activities are valid and aligned with the goals. Following these rules will help in generating valid plans to achieve the specified goals in the problem.
