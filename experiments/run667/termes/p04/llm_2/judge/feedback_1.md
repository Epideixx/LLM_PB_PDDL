No, the two texts do not describe the same problem PDDL. Here are the main differences:

1. Initial Heights:
   - The original description does not mention that all positions start at height h1. It only states that the depot is at pos-1-0, and does not specify initial heights for positions.
   - The given description explicitly states that all positions initially have a height of h1.

2. Height Representation:
   - The original description does not specify the heights using h1, h2, h3, and h4. It simply states the required heights for specific positions.
   - The given description uses height levels (h1, h2, h3, h4) to describe the heights and their successor relationships.

3. Connectivity:
   - The original description does not mention the connectivity or neighbor relationships between positions on the grid.
   - The given description explicitly describes the neighbor relationships and connectivity between grid positions.

4. Initial Position of the Robot:
   - The original description specifies that the robot is initially at pos-1-0.
   - The given description mentions that the current position is pos-1-0 but does not explicitly state that the robot starts there.

5. Goal Condition:
   - The original description specifies the goal heights for pos-2-0 (height 3) and pos-3-2 (height 4).
   - The given description specifies the same goal heights but uses height levels h3 and h4 respectively.

6. Unplaced Blocks:
   - The original description specifies that there cannot be any unplaced blocks at the end.
   - The given description also includes this condition, indicating that all blocks must be properly positioned according to the specified heights.

These differences indicate that the two descriptions are not describing the same problem PDDL, as there are substantial differences in the initial state, representation of heights, and additional contextual details about the grid and movements.
