Great! Let's break down the initial and goal states based on the given problem description and domain.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

**Initial State:**
1. **Robot Position:** The robot starts at position pos-1-0.
2. **Depot Location:** The depot for new blocks is at pos-1-0.
3. **Initial Heights:** The heights at all positions are initially zero unless otherwise specified.
4. **Block Availability:** The robot doesn't initially have any blocks.

**Goal State:**
1. **Target Heights:**
   - The height at pos-2-0 should be 3.
   - The height at pos-3-2 should be 4.
2. **No Unplaced Blocks:** There should be no unplaced blocks remaining.

### Step 2: Describe Connections Between Objects in Natural Language

**Initial State:**

1. **Robot Position:**
   - The robot is initially located at pos-1-0.
   
2. **Depot Location:**
   - The depot for new blocks is at the same position where the robot starts, pos-1-0.
   
3. **Positions and Heights:**
   - All positions on the grid have an initial height of 0. These positions are:
     - pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2
     - pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2
     - pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2
     - pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2
   
4. **Block Availability:**
   - The robot does not have any blocks at the beginning.

**Goal State:**

1. **Target Heights:**
   - The position pos-2-0 must have a height of 3.
   - The position pos-3-2 must have a height of 4.
   - The heights at the other positions must remain unchanged from their initial state (which is 0).

2. **No Unplaced Blocks:**
   - At the end, there should be no unplaced blocks, meaning all blocks must be placed as per the height requirements.

### Summary:

**Initial State in Natural Language:**

- The robot starts at position pos-1-0.
- The depot for new blocks is located at pos-1-0.
- All positions (pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2, pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2, pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2, pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2) have an initial height of 0.
- The robot does not initially have any blocks.

**Goal State in Natural Language:**

- The height at position pos-2-0 should be 3.
- The height at position pos-3-2 should be 4.
- The heights at all other positions should remain at their initial values (which is 0).
- There should be no unplaced blocks remaining at the end.

This breakdown helps in understanding the connections and relationships between the objects in both the initial and goal states, providing a clear picture of the problem requirements.
