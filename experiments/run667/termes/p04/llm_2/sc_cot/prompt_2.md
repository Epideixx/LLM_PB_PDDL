Given the provided problem description, we need to determine the number of objects for each type specified in the domain PDDL.

### Text Analysis:
- **Grid Dimensions:** 4 rows and 3 columns, leading to 12 positions in total.
- **Positions:**
  - pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2
  - pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2
  - pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2
  - pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2
- **Depot:** Located at pos-1-0.
- **Initial Robot Position:** pos-1-0.
- **Maximum Block Height:** 4.
- **Goals:**
  - Height at pos-2-0 should be 3.
  - Height at pos-3-2 should be 4.
- **Constraints:** No unplaced blocks at the end.

### Objects:
1. **Positions:** There are 12 positions.
2. **Numerical Values (numb):** Since the maximum height of blocks is 4, we have numerical values ranging from 1 to 4.

### Answer:
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 4
}
```

This reflects the number of objects for each type according to the problem description associated with the given domain PDDL.
