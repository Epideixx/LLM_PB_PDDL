system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : As expert in PDDL, your mission is to return the final translation from a problem formulated in natural language to a Problem PDDL. To do so, you will be given the domain PDDL, the original description of the task that you have to translate, as well as multiple potential versions of this translation. Your goal is then to either pick one of the translations, or to combine them in a smart way. Before picking the final PDDL translation, you will think and explain your reasoning.
 The final translation will be between 'START TRANSLATION' and 'END TRANSLATION'. Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain termes)

And this is the description of the task we aim to translate:
The robot is on a grid with 4 rows and 3 columns. 
pos-0-0 pos-0-1 pos-0-2 
pos-1-0 pos-1-1 pos-1-2 
pos-2-0 pos-2-1 pos-2-2 
pos-3-0 pos-3-1 pos-3-2 
The depot for new blocks is at pos-1-0. 
The robot is at pos-1-0. 
The maximum height of blocks is 4. 
Your goal is to build blocks so that the height at pos-2-0 is 3, the height at pos-3-2 is 4. 
The heights at the other positions remain unchanged.
You cannot have an unplaced block at the end.

Finally, to help you, we generated potential translations of this task:

assistant : Let's analyze the given translations and determine the best approach to create the final PDDL problem definition.

### Analysis of Potential Translations

#### Potential Translation 1:
- **Objects**: Defines all positions and height levels correctly.
- **Initial State**:
  - Specifies the initial position of the robot.
  - Defines the depot location.
  - Lists all neighboring positions.
  - Specifies successor relationships for height levels.
- **Goal State**:
  - Specifies the desired heights at `pos-2-0` and `pos-3-2`.
  - Ensures no unplaced block at the end.

#### Potential Translation 2:
- **Objects**: Defines all positions and height levels correctly.
- **Initial State**:
  - Specifies the initial position of the robot.
  - Defines the depot location.
  - Lists all neighboring positions.
  - Specifies successor relationships for height levels.
  - Additionally, initializes the height at all positions to `h0`.
- **Goal State**:
  - Specifies the desired heights at `pos-2-0` and `pos-3-2`.
  - Ensures heights at other positions remain unchanged.
  - Ensures no unplaced block at the end.

### Reasoning

Both translations are quite similar, but Potential Translation 2 is more comprehensive in terms of specifying the initial heights at all positions and ensuring that the heights at other positions remain unchanged in the goal state. This additional detail aligns well with the task description, which states that the heights at other positions should remain unchanged.

### Final Translation

Combining the strengths of both translations, we will use the comprehensive initial state and goal state from Potential Translation 2. Here is the final PDDL problem definition:
