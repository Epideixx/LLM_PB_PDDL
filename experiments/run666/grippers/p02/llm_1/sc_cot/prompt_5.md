Certainly! Let's break down the initial and goal states based on the provided information.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

#### Initial State:
- The locations of robots and balls.
- The state of the grippers (whether they are free or occupied).

#### Goal State:
- The desired final locations of the balls.

### Step 2: Describe the Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State:
1. **Robot Locations**:
   - robot2 is in room3.
   - robot1 is in room2.

2. **Ball Locations**:
   - ball1 is in room3.
   - ball2 is in room1.
   - ball3 is in room1.
   - ball4 is in room3.

3. **Gripper States**:
   - robot1's left gripper is free.
   - robot1's right gripper is free.
   - robot2's left gripper is free.
   - robot2's right gripper is free.

#### Goal State:
1. **Ball Locations**:
   - ball1 should be in room2.
   - ball2 should be in room2.
   - ball3 should be in room3.
   - ball4 should be in room3.

### Summary in Natural Language

#### Initial State Description:
- Robot2 is currently located in room3.
- Robot1 is currently located in room2.
- Ball1 is located in room3.
- Ball2 is located in room1.
- Ball3 is located in room1.
- Ball4 is located in room3.
- All grippers for both robots (left and right grippers for robot1 and robot2) are free, meaning they are not holding any objects.

#### Goal State Description:
- Ball1 needs to be transported to and placed in room2.
- Ball2 needs to be transported to and placed in room2.
- Ball3 needs to be transported to and placed in room3.
- Ball4 needs to be transported to and placed in room3.

By following these steps and descriptions, we can clearly understand the initial and goal states of the problem in the context of the given domain.
