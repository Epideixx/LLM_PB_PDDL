Based on the provided text, we need to identify the number of objects for each type defined in the domain PDDL (rooms, robots, grippers, and balls).

### Objects and Their Counts

1. **robot**: 2 (You control 2 robots)
2. **gripper**: 4 (Each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper, so 2 robots * 2 grippers each = 4 grippers)
3. **room**: 3 (There are 3 rooms)
4. **ball**: 4 (There are 4 balls)

### Answer
```json
{
  "robot": 2,
  "gripper": 4,
  "room": 3,
  "ball": 4
}
```

This provides the number of objects for each type as requested.
