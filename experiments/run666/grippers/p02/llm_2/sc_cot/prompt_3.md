To extract the names of each object, we need to identify all instances of robots, grippers, rooms, and balls from the provided text.

### Identified Objects and Their Names

1. **robot**: 
   - robot1
   - robot2

2. **gripper**: 
   - The text mentions that each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. We can name them as follows:
     - robot1-left-gripper
     - robot1-right-gripper
     - robot2-left-gripper
     - robot2-right-gripper

3. **room**: 
   - room1
   - room2
   - room3

4. **ball**: 
   - ball1
   - ball2
   - ball3

### Answer
```json

  "robot": ["robot1", "robot2"],
  "gripper": ["robot1-left-gripper", "robot1-right-gripper", "robot2-left-gripper", "robot2-right-gripper"],
  "room": ["room1", "room2", "room3"],
