Let's break down the provided text to identify the initial and goal states for the problem. We'll follow the steps as outlined.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
- You control 2 robots: robot1 and robot2.
- Each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper: robot1-left-gripper, robot1-right-gripper, robot2-left-gripper, robot2-right-gripper.
- There are 3 rooms: room1, room2, room3.
- There are 4 balls: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4.
- robot2 is in room3.
- robot1 is in room2.
- ball1 is in room3.
- ball2 is in room1.
- ball4 is in room3.
- ball3 is in room1.
- The robots' grippers are free.

#### Goal State
- ball1 should be in room2.
- ball2 should be in room2.
- ball3 should be in room3.
- ball4 should be in room3.

### Step 2: Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State
1. **Robot Locations**:
   - robot1 is located in room2.
   - robot2 is located in room3.

2. **Ball Locations**:
   - ball1 is located in room3.
   - ball2 is located in room1.
   - ball3 is located in room1.
   - ball4 is located in room3.

3. **Gripper States**:
   - The left and right grippers of robot1 (robot1-left-gripper and robot1-right-gripper) are free.
   - The left and right grippers of robot2 (robot2-left-gripper and robot2-right-gripper) are free.

#### Goal State
1. **Ball Locations**:
   - ball1 should be located in room2.
   - ball2 should be located in room2.
   - ball3 should be located in room3.
   - ball4 should be located in room3.

### Summary

#### Initial State in Natural Language
- robot1 is in room2.
- robot2 is in room3.
- ball1 is in room3.
- ball2 is in room1.
- ball3 is in room1.
- ball4 is in room3.
- The left and right grippers of robot1 are free.
- The left and right grippers of robot2 are free.

#### Goal State in Natural Language
- ball1 should be in room2.
- ball2 should be in room2.
- ball3 should be in room3.
- ball4 should be in room3.

This clear differentiation and description of the initial and goal states provide a solid foundation for formulating the problem in PDDL and understanding the objectives that need to be achieved.
