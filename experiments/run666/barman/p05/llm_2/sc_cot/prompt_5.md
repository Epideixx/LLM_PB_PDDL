### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:

- **Shaker**:
  - 1 shaker (clean, empty, on the table).

- **Levels**:
  - 3 levels (not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but assumed to be empty).

- **Shot Glasses**:
  - 5 shot glasses (clean, empty, on the table).

- **Dispensers**:
  - 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients (ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3).

- **Hands**:
  - Both hands (left and right) are empty.

- **Cocktail Recipes**:
  - cocktail1: ingredient2 and ingredient1.
  - cocktail2: ingredient1 and ingredient2.
  - cocktail3: ingredient1 and ingredient3.
  - cocktail4: ingredient3 and ingredient2.

#### Goal State:

- **Cocktails in Shot Glasses**:
  - shot1 contains cocktail1.
  - shot2 contains cocktail4.
  - shot3 contains cocktail3.
  - shot4 contains cocktail2.

### Step 2: Connections Between Objects in Natural Language

#### Initial State:

1. **Shaker and Shot Glasses**:
   - There is one clean and empty shaker placed on the table.
   - There are five clean and empty shot glasses placed on the table.

2. **Dispensers and Ingredients**:
   - There are three dispensers, each capable of dispensing one of the three ingredients (ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3).

3. **Hands**:
   - Both the left and right hands are empty.

4. **Cocktail Recipes**:
   - Cocktail1 is made from ingredient2 and ingredient1.
   - Cocktail2 is made from ingredient1 and ingredient2.
   - Cocktail3 is made from ingredient1 and ingredient3.
   - Cocktail4 is made from ingredient3 and ingredient2.

#### Goal State:

1. **Cocktails in Shot Glasses**:
   - Shot glass `shot1` should contain cocktail1 (made from ingredient2 and ingredient1).
   - Shot glass `shot2` should contain cocktail4 (made from ingredient3 and ingredient2).
   - Shot glass `shot3` should contain cocktail3 (made from ingredient1 and ingredient3).
   - Shot glass `shot4` should contain cocktail2 (made from ingredient1 and ingredient2).

This detailed description of the initial and goal states provides a clear understanding of the starting conditions and the desired end conditions for the problem in the given domain.
