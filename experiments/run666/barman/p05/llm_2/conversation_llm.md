system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you now have to explain clearly the initial and goal state. To do so, please follow the next steps.
Step 1. Analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state
Step 2. For each of the states, please write in natural language the connections between the objects. For example if one is on top on the other, or located next to each other, or if an object is free, ...

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : ### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:

- **Shaker**:
  - 1 shaker (clean, empty, on the table).

- **Levels**:
  - 3 levels (not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but assumed to be empty).

- **Shot Glasses**:
  - 5 shot glasses (clean, empty, on the table).

- **Dispensers**:
  - 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients (ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3).

- **Hands**:
  - Both hands (left and right) are empty.

- **Cocktail Recipes**:
  - cocktail1: ingredient2 and ingredient1.
  - cocktail2: ingredient1 and ingredient2.
  - cocktail3: ingredient1 and ingredient3.
  - cocktail4: ingredient3 and ingredient2.

#### Goal State:

- **Cocktails in Shot Glasses**:
  - shot1 contains cocktail1.
  - shot2 contains cocktail4.
  - shot3 contains cocktail3.
  - shot4 contains cocktail2.

### Step 2: Connections Between Objects in Natural Language

#### Initial State:

1. **Shaker and Shot Glasses**:
   - There is one clean and empty shaker placed on the table.
   - There are five clean and empty shot glasses placed on the table.

2. **Dispensers and Ingredients**:
   - There are three dispensers, each capable of dispensing one of the three ingredients (ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3).

3. **Hands**:
   - Both the left and right hands are empty.

4. **Cocktail Recipes**:
   - Cocktail1 is made from ingredient2 and ingredient1.
   - Cocktail2 is made from ingredient1 and ingredient2.
   - Cocktail3 is made from ingredient1 and ingredient3.
   - Cocktail4 is made from ingredient3 and ingredient2.

#### Goal State:

1. **Cocktails in Shot Glasses**:
   - Shot glass `shot1` should contain cocktail1 (made from ingredient2 and ingredient1).
   - Shot glass `shot2` should contain cocktail4 (made from ingredient3 and ingredient2).
   - Shot glass `shot3` should contain cocktail3 (made from ingredient1 and ingredient3).
   - Shot glass `shot4` should contain cocktail2 (made from ingredient1 and ingredient2).

This detailed description of the initial and goal states provides a clear understanding of the starting conditions and the desired end conditions for the problem in the given domain.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Your task is to evaluate if a given problem PDDL is correct and accurately corresponds to the natural description of it, as well as using the provided domain PDDL. You will provide feedback based on the following questions. Note that feedback is only required if the problem PDDL does not match the provided description of it. If no feedback is required, you will simply write "No feedback required."
1. Are any necessary objects missing?  
2. Are any unnecessary objects included?  
3. Are any objects defined with the wrong type?  
4. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?  
5. Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?  
6. Is anything missing from the goal description?  
7. Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?  
8. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?

To help you better understand what is expected from you, here are three examples. Those are all based on the same domain PDDL and on the same description.

Description:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- The airport in Los Angeles has not been declared in the objects, you should declare the object "ala" (at Los Angeles) and you should declare it as an "airport" in the initial conditions as well as a location. 
- The airport at Pittsburgh was declared twice in the initial conditions
- The airport at Pittsburgh (apgh) is wrongly declared at city Los Angeles (cla), and shoudl only be declared at Pittsburgh
- In the goals, there is a mistake about the final location of of package 4 (o4), which should be at Los Angeles airport (ala), and not at Pittsburgh.

- o6 shoudl be initialized as an object, not as a location.
- The predicate (at p2 ala) is not expected to be in the goal, as it was not demanded in the description of the problem.
