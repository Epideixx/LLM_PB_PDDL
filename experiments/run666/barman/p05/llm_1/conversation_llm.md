system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain barman)

This should give you a detailed understanding of the types and predicates in the given domain PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Using your understanding of the domain, you will now have to understand a problem, formulated in natural language, which is associated with the previous domain PDDL. Your first mission is to collect the number of objects for each type. 

To guide you, I will provide you with an example which belongs to another domain.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’table’: 2, ’apple’: 4, ’orange’: 3, ’plate’: 5, ’ball’: 3, ’kid’: 3, ’cell’: 8}

Now it is your turn, for the following problem:
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2. 

Answer:


--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Based on the provided text, let's identify and count the number of objects for each type in the given problem:

- **shaker**: 1
- **level**: 3 (since the shaker has 3 levels)
- **shot** (shot glasses): 5
- **dispenser**: 3
- **ingredient**: 3
- **cocktail**: 4
- **hand**: 2 (left and right hands)

Here is the answer in a structured format:

```json
{
    "shaker": 1,
    "level": 3,
    "shot": 5,
    "dispenser": 3,
    "ingredient": 3,
    "cocktail": 4,
    "hand": 2
}
```

This accurately represents the counts of each type of object mentioned in the problem text.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you will now have to extract the names of each object. 

To guide you, we will keep the same example as previously. As a reminder, here it is.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’apple’: [’apple1’, ’apple2’], ’orange’: [], ’plate’: [’plate_1’, ’plate_2’, ’plate_3’, ’plate_4’, ’plate_5’], ’table’: [’table1’, ’table2’], ’ball’: [’ball1’, ’ball3’], ’room’: [’hall’], ’kid’: [], ’robot’: [], ’cell’: [’cell_0_1’, ’cell_0_2’, ’cell_1_1’, ’cell_1_2’, ’cell_2_1’, ’cell_2_2’, ’cell_3_1’, ’cell_3_2’]}

Now it is your turn, for our current problem:
Text:

- **shaker**: [‘shaker1’]
- **level**: [‘level1’, ‘level2’, ‘level3’]
- **shot** (shot glasses): [‘shot1’, ‘shot2’, ‘shot3’, ‘shot4’, ‘shot5’]
- **dispenser**: [‘dispenser1’, ‘dispenser2’, ‘dispenser3’]
- **ingredient**: [‘ingredient1’, ‘ingredient2’, ‘ingredient3’]
- **cocktail**: [‘cocktail1’, ‘cocktail2’, ‘cocktail3’, ‘cocktail4’]
- **hand**: [‘left_hand’, ‘right_hand’]

Here is the answer in a structured format:

```json
{
    "shaker": ["shaker1"],
    "level": ["level1", "level2", "level3"],
    "shot": ["shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4", "shot5"],
    "dispenser": ["dispenser1", "dispenser2", "dispenser3"],
    "ingredient": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
    "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
    "hand": ["left_hand", "right_hand"]
}
```

This accurately represents the names of each object mentioned in the problem text.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Now you have a better understanding of the domain and the problem we have to deal with, you will have to create and think about rules in this domain, that you should follow.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : ### Rules in the Barman Domain

Given the domain and the problem, we can formulate a set of rules to guide how actions should be performed to achieve the goal of making 4 cocktails. These rules will be based on the preconditions and effects of the actions provided in the domain PDDL, as well as the logical flow of operations in a barman setting.

#### General Rules

1. **Empty Hands**: 
   - Before picking up any container (shaker or shot), the hand must be empty.
   - A hand can only hold one container at a time.

2. **Container States**:
   - A container (shaker or shot) must be clean before it can be used.
   - A container must be empty before it can be filled with a beverage or ingredient.

3. **Dispensing Ingredients**:
   - Ingredients can only be dispensed into empty and clean shot glasses.
   - The dispenser must be able to dispense the specific ingredient.

4. **Shaker Usage**:
   - A shaker must be empty and clean before pouring ingredients into it.
   - The shaker levels must be managed correctly according to the `next` predicate.
   - Shaking the shaker is required to mix ingredients into a cocktail.

5. **Cocktail Preparation**:
   - Each cocktail has specific ingredients that must be added to the shaker.
   - The shaker must be shaken to prepare the cocktail before emptying it into a shot glass.

#### Specific Rules Based on Actions

   - There are 3 dispensers named `dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, and `dispenser3`.
   - Each dispenser is capable of dispensing one of the ingredients: `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, and `ingredient3`.

4. **Hands**:
   - Both the left hand (`left_hand`) and the right hand (`right_hand`) are empty.

5. **Ingredients for Cocktails**:
   - `cocktail1` is made from `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail2` is made from `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail3` is made from `ingredient1` and `ingredient3`.
   - `cocktail4` is made from `ingredient2` and `ingredient3`.

#### Goal State in Natural Language

1. **Cocktails**:
   - 4 cocktails need to be prepared and placed in specific shot glasses.
   - `shot1` should contain `cocktail1`.
   - `shot2` should contain `cocktail4`.
   - `shot3` should contain `cocktail3`.
   - `shot4` should contain `cocktail2`.

### Summary

The initial state describes the conditions and positions of all objects at the start, including the cleanliness, emptiness, and location of the shaker and shot glasses, the status of the hands, and the ingredients required for each cocktail.

The goal state describes the final condition where 4 specific cocktails must be made and placed in the designated shot glasses.

By following these initial and goal states, the actions can be planned to transition from the initial state to the goal state, ensuring the correct preparation and placement of each cocktail.

user : Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2.

### Explanation:

1. **Objects**:
   - Defined the objects for each type: shaker, levels, shot glasses, dispensers, ingredients, cocktails, and hands.

2. **Initial State**:
   - Shaker: The shaker is clean, empty, on the table, and at the initial level (level1).
   - Shot Glasses: All shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.
   - Hands: Both hands are empty.
   - Dispensers: Each dispenser can dispense a specific ingredient.
   - Levels: Defined the relationship between levels using the `next` predicate.
   - Cocktails: Defined the ingredients required for each cocktail.

3. **Goal State**:
   - Specified that each shot glass should contain the corresponding cocktail as per the goal description.

This PDDL problem definition accurately reflects the initial and goal states based on the provided text and the domain structure.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Your task is to evaluate if a given problem PDDL is correct and accurately corresponds to the natural description of it, as well as using the provided domain PDDL. You will provide feedback based on the following questions. Note that feedback is only required if the problem PDDL does not match the provided description of it. If no feedback is required, you will simply write "No feedback required."
1. Are any necessary objects missing?  
2. Are any unnecessary objects included?  
3. Are any objects defined with the wrong type?  
4. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?  
5. Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?  
6. Is anything missing from the goal description?  
7. Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?  
8. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?

To help you better understand what is expected from you, here are three examples. Those are all based on the same domain PDDL and on the same description.

Description:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- The airport in Los Angeles has not been declared in the objects, you should declare the object "ala" (at Los Angeles) and you should declare it as an "airport" in the initial conditions as well as a location. 
- The airport at Pittsburgh was declared twice in the initial conditions
- The airport at Pittsburgh (apgh) is wrongly declared at city Los Angeles (cla), and shoudl only be declared at Pittsburgh
- In the goals, there is a mistake about the final location of of package 4 (o4), which should be at Los Angeles airport (ala), and not at Pittsburgh.

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- Only two planes should be declared, not three. Please remove one.
- aphg, corresponding to Pittsburgh airport has not been initialized as an airport, which should be done.
- o6 shoudl be initialized as an object, not as a location.
- The predicate (at p2 ala) is not expected to be in the goal, as it was not demanded in the description of the problem.
