Based on the provided text, let's identify and extract the names of each object for each type:

- **shaker**: [‘shaker1’]
- **level**: [‘level1’, ‘level2’, ‘level3’]
- **shot** (shot glasses): [‘shot1’, ‘shot2’, ‘shot3’, ‘shot4’, ‘shot5’]
- **dispenser**: [‘dispenser1’, ‘dispenser2’, ‘dispenser3’]
- **ingredient**: [‘ingredient1’, ‘ingredient2’, ‘ingredient3’]
- **cocktail**: [‘cocktail1’, ‘cocktail2’, ‘cocktail3’, ‘cocktail4’]
- **hand**: [‘left_hand’, ‘right_hand’]

Here is the answer in a structured format:

```json
{
    "shaker": ["shaker1"],
    "level": ["level1", "level2", "level3"],
    "shot": ["shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4", "shot5"],
    "dispenser": ["dispenser1", "dispenser2", "dispenser3"],
    "ingredient": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
    "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
    "hand": ["left_hand", "right_hand"]
}
```

This accurately represents the names of each object mentioned in the problem text.
