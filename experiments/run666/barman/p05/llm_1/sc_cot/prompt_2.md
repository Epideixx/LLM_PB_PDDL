Based on the provided text, let's identify and count the number of objects for each type in the given problem:

- **shaker**: 1
- **level**: 3 (since the shaker has 3 levels)
- **shot** (shot glasses): 5
- **dispenser**: 3
- **ingredient**: 3
- **cocktail**: 4
- **hand**: 2 (left and right hands)

Here is the answer in a structured format:

```json
{
    "shaker": 1,
    "level": 3,
    "shot": 5,
    "dispenser": 3,
    "ingredient": 3,
    "cocktail": 4,
    "hand": 2
}
```

This accurately represents the counts of each type of object mentioned in the problem text.
