### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State

From the problem text, the initial state includes:
1. **Shaker**:
   - 1 shaker
   - 3 levels
   - The shaker is clean, empty, and on the table.

2. **Shot Glasses**:
   - 5 shot glasses
   - All shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.

3. **Dispensers**:
   - 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients.

4. **Hands**:
   - Both left and right hands are empty.

5. **Ingredients for Cocktails**:
   - cocktail1: ingredient1 and ingredient2
   - cocktail2: ingredient1 and ingredient2
   - cocktail3: ingredient1 and ingredient3
   - cocktail4: ingredient2 and ingredient3

#### Goal State

The goal state includes:
1. **Cocktails**:
   - 4 cocktails need to be made.
   - shot1 should contain cocktail1.
   - shot2 should contain cocktail4.
   - shot3 should contain cocktail3.
   - shot4 should contain cocktail2.

### Step 2: Write Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State in Natural Language

1. **Shaker**:
   - There is 1 shaker named `shaker1`. It has 3 levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`).
   - The shaker is clean, empty, and positioned on the table.

2. **Shot Glasses**:
   - There are 5 shot glasses named `shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, and `shot5`.
   - All shot glasses are clean, empty, and positioned on the table.

3. **Dispensers**:
   - There are 3 dispensers named `dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, and `dispenser3`.
   - Each dispenser is capable of dispensing one of the ingredients: `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, and `ingredient3`.

4. **Hands**:
   - Both the left hand (`left_hand`) and the right hand (`right_hand`) are empty.

5. **Ingredients for Cocktails**:
   - `cocktail1` is made from `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail2` is made from `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail3` is made from `ingredient1` and `ingredient3`.
   - `cocktail4` is made from `ingredient2` and `ingredient3`.

#### Goal State in Natural Language

1. **Cocktails**:
   - 4 cocktails need to be prepared and placed in specific shot glasses.
   - `shot1` should contain `cocktail1`.
   - `shot2` should contain `cocktail4`.
   - `shot3` should contain `cocktail3`.
   - `shot4` should contain `cocktail2`.

### Summary

The initial state describes the conditions and positions of all objects at the start, including the cleanliness, emptiness, and location of the shaker and shot glasses, the status of the hands, and the ingredients required for each cocktail.

The goal state describes the final condition where 4 specific cocktails must be made and placed in the designated shot glasses.

By following these initial and goal states, the actions can be planned to transition from the initial state to the goal state, ensuring the correct preparation and placement of each cocktail.
