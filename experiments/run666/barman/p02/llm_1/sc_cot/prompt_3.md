Based on the provided text, let's extract the names of each object:

- **shaker**: There is 1 shaker, but the text does not provide a specific name, so we can assume a default name.
- **level**: The levels are associated with the shaker, and no specific names are provided, so we can assume default names.
- **shot**: The text mentions 4 shot glasses, and the specific names given are shot1, shot2, and shot3.
- **dispenser**: There are 3 dispensers, but no specific names are provided, so we can assume default names.
- **ingredient**: There are 3 ingredients, and the specific names given are ingredient1, ingredient2, and ingredient3.
- **cocktail**: There are 3 cocktails, and the specific names given are cocktail1, cocktail2, and cocktail3.
- **hand**: The text specifies left and right hands.

So, the answer is:

```json
{
    "shaker": ["shaker1"],  // assuming a default name
    "level": ["level1", "level2", "level3"],  // assuming default names
    "shot": ["shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4"],  // including an additional assumed name shot4
    "dispenser": ["dispenser1", "dispenser2", "dispenser3"],  // assuming default names
    "ingredient": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
    "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3"],
    "hand": ["left_hand", "right_hand"]  // using specified names
}
```
