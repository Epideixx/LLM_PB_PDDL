### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
The initial state describes the starting conditions of all objects and their relationships. From the provided text, the initial state includes:

- 1 shaker with 3 levels.
- 4 shot glasses.
- 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients.
- The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Both the left and right hands are empty.
- Specific ingredients associated with each cocktail:
  - First ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient3.
  - Second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1.
  - First ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient3.
  - Second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2.

  - Second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1.

#### Goal State
The goal state describes the desired conditions and relationships that need to be achieved:

- 3 cocktails need to be made.
- Specific shot glasses need to contain specific cocktails:
  - shot1 contains cocktail1.
  - shot2 contains cocktail3.
  - shot3 contains cocktail2.

### Step 2: Describe Connections in Natural Language

   - There is 1 shaker named "shaker1".
   - The shaker has 3 levels named "level1", "level2", and "level3".
   - The shaker is clean and empty.
   - The shaker is on the table.

2. **Shot Glasses:**
   - There are 4 shot glasses named "shot1", "shot2", "shot3", and "shot4".
   - All shot glasses are clean and empty.
   - All shot glasses are on the table.

3. **Dispensers:**
   - There are 3 dispensers named "dispenser1", "dispenser2", and "dispenser3".
   - Each dispenser is associated with one of the ingredients.

4. **Ingredients:**
   - There are 3 ingredients named "ingredient1", "ingredient2", and "ingredient3".
   - ingredient1 is in dispenser1.
   - ingredient2 is in dispenser2.
   - ingredient3 is in dispenser3.

5. **Hands:**
   - There are 2 hands named "left_hand" and "right_hand".
   - Both hands are empty.

6. **Cocktail Ingredients:**
   - cocktail1 is made of ingredient3 and ingredient1.
   - cocktail2 is made of ingredient3 and ingredient2.
   - cocktail3 is made of ingredient3 and ingredient1.

#### Goal State
1. **Cocktails in Shot Glasses:**
   - shot1 contains cocktail1.
   - shot2 contains cocktail3.
   - shot3 contains cocktail2.

### Summary in Natural Language

#### Initial State
- The barman has a shaker named "shaker1" with three levels ("level1", "level2", and "level3"). The shaker is clean, empty, and placed on the table.
- There are four shot glasses ("shot1", "shot2", "shot3", and "shot4"). All shot glasses are clean, empty, and placed on the table.
- There are three dispensers ("dispenser1", "dispenser2", and "dispenser3"), each containing one of the three ingredients ("ingredient1", "ingredient2", and "ingredient3").
- The left and right hands of the barman are empty.
- The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient3, and the second ingredient is ingredient1.
- The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient3, and the second ingredient is ingredient2.
- The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3, and the second ingredient is ingredient1.

#### Goal State
- The barman needs to make three cocktails.
- The first shot glass (shot1) should contain cocktail1.
- The second shot glass (shot2) should contain cocktail3.
- The third shot glass (shot3) should contain cocktail2.

This detailed description of the initial and goal states provides a clear understanding of the starting conditions and the desired outcomes in natural language, making it easier to plan the necessary actions to achieve the goals.
