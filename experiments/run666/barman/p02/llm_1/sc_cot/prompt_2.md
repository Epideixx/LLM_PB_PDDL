Based on the provided text, let's extract and count the number of objects for each type:

- **shaker**: 1
- **level**: 3 (since the shaker has 3 levels)
- **shot**: 4 (shot glasses)
- **dispenser**: 3
- **ingredient**: 3
- **cocktail**: 3 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3)
- **hand**: 2 (left and right hands)

So, the answer is:

```json
{
    "shaker": 1,
    "level": 3,
    "shot": 4,
    "dispenser": 3,
    "ingredient": 3,
    "cocktail": 3,
    "hand": 2
}
```
