Sure, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State:**
- You have 1 shaker with 3 levels.
- You have 4 shot glasses.
- You have 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients.
- The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Your left and right hands are empty.
- The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient3.
- The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1.
- The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient3.
- The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2.
- The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3.
- The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1.

**Goal State:**
- Your goal is to make 3 cocktails.
- shot1 contains cocktail1.
- shot2 contains cocktail3.
- shot3 contains cocktail2.

### Step 2: Write in Natural Language the Connections Between the Objects

#### Initial State:
1. **Shaker and Levels:**
   - There is one shaker (`shaker1`) which has three levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`).
   - The shaker is clean and empty.
   - The shaker is on the table.

2. **Shot Glasses:**
   - There are four shot glasses (`shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`).
   - All shot glasses are clean and empty.
   - All shot glasses are on the table.

3. **Dispensers and Ingredients:**
   - There are three dispensers (`dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, `dispenser3`).
   - Each dispenser contains a specific ingredient:
     - `dispenser1` dispenses `ingredient1`.
     - `dispenser2` dispenses `ingredient2`.
     - `dispenser3` dispenses `ingredient3`.

4. **Hands:**
   - Both your left hand (`left_hand`) and right hand (`right_hand`) are empty.

5. **Cocktails and Ingredients:**
   - `cocktail1` requires:
     - First ingredient: `ingredient3`
     - Second ingredient: `ingredient1`
   - `cocktail2` requires:
     - First ingredient: `ingredient3`
     - Second ingredient: `ingredient2`
   - `cocktail3` requires:
     - First ingredient: `ingredient3`
     - Second ingredient: `ingredient1`

#### Goal State:
1. **Cocktails in Shot Glasses:**
   - `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
   - `shot2` contains `cocktail3`.
   - `shot3` contains `cocktail2`.

### Summary in Natural Language:

**Initial State:**
- There is a single shaker on the table, which is clean and empty. It has three levels used to measure its contents.
- Four shot glasses are on the table; all are clean and empty.
- Three dispensers are present, each containing a different ingredient.
- Both of your hands are free.
- You know the ingredient requirements for three cocktails:
  - Cocktail1 needs ingredient3 and ingredient1.
  - Cocktail2 needs ingredient3 and ingredient2.
  - Cocktail3 needs ingredient3 and ingredient1.

**Goal State:**
- You need to prepare three cocktails and distribute them into specific shot glasses:
  - Shot1 should contain cocktail1.
  - Shot2 should contain cocktail3.
  - Shot3 should contain cocktail2.

This detailed breakdown aligns with the connections and relationships between objects as described in the problem and provides a clear understanding of both the initial and goal states.
