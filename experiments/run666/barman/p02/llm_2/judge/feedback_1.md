No, the two texts do not describe the same problem PDDL. Here are the differences:

1. **Levels of Shaker**: The original description mentions "1 shaker with 3 levels" but does not specify the names of these levels. The given description specifies three levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`) and includes them in the initial state.

2. **Initial State of Shaker**: The given description mentions that `shaker1` is at `level1`, which is not specified in the original description.

3. **Additional Details**: The given description includes additional details about the levels being ordered sequentially (`level1` is followed by `level2`, `level2` is followed by `level3`), which are not mentioned in the original description.

4. **Shot Glasses**: Both descriptions mention four shot glasses, but the given description includes an additional shot glass (`shot4`) which is not mentioned in the original description.

5. **Dispenser Details**: Both descriptions mention three dispensers for three ingredients, but the given description specifies the mapping of dispensers to ingredients explicitly:
    - `dispenser1` dispenses `ingredient1`
    - `dispenser2` dispenses `ingredient2`
    - `dispenser3` dispenses `ingredient3`

6. **Initial State of Shot Glasses and Hands**: Both descriptions mention that the shot glasses and hands are clean, empty, and on the table, but the given description explicitly states this for each shot glass and both hands, which is more detailed than the original.

7. **Cocktail Ingredients**: Both descriptions match in terms of the ingredients required for each cocktail.

8. **Goal State**: Both descriptions match in terms of the final goal state of the shot glasses containing the respective cocktails.

These differences indicate that while the core goals and objects are similar, the initial states and additional details vary between the two descriptions.
