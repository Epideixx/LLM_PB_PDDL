No, the two texts do not describe the same problem PDDL. Here are the main differences:

1. **Height Levels**: The given description introduces height levels (h0, h1, h2, h3) which are not mentioned in the original description. The original description only states that the maximum height of blocks is 3, without specifying intermediate height levels.

2. **Neighbor Relationships**: The given description includes detailed neighbor relationships between positions, which are not mentioned in the original description. The original problem does not specify or require any adjacency relationships between positions.

3. **Successor Relationships**: The given description defines height successor relationships (e.g., h0 is followed by h1, h1 is followed by h2, etc.), which are not present in the original description.

4. **Initial Height Information**: The given description states that all positions initially have a height of h0. The original description does not mention the initial height of the positions explicitly but implies that they are initially empty since the goal involves adding blocks to reach specific heights.

5. **No Unplaced Blocks Predicate**: The given description includes a specific predicate (not (has-block)) to ensure no unplaced blocks at the end. The original description simply states that you cannot have an unplaced block without specifying a predicate.

These differences indicate that the problem setups and the level of detail in the descriptions are not the same, leading to different interpretations of the problem PDDL.
