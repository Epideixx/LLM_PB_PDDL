Let's break down the problem into its initial state and goal state, and describe the connections and conditions in natural language.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State:**
- The robot's initial position.
- The depot's location.
- The initial heights of blocks at each position.
- Any other initial conditions explicitly stated or implied.

**Goal State:**
- The desired heights of blocks at specific positions.
- Ensure no unplaced blocks at the end.

### Step 2: Describe the States in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
1. **Robot Position:**
   - The robot is initially located at position `pos-2-0`.

2. **Depot Location:**
   - The depot for creating new blocks is located at `pos-2-0`.

3. **Initial Heights:**
   - The initial heights of blocks at all positions are not explicitly given, but can be assumed to be zero unless stated otherwise.
   - The heights at other positions (besides `pos-2-1` and `pos-3-0`) should remain unchanged, implying that they might initially be zero or some other fixed value.

**Goal State:**
1. **Desired Heights:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-1` should be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-0` should be 3.
   
2. **Unplaced Blocks:**
   - There should be no unplaced blocks at the end. This means all blocks created must be placed at their respective positions.

### Natural Language Description

**Initial State Description:**
1. **Robot's Initial Position:**
   - The robot is currently at position `pos-2-0`.

2. **Depot Location:**
   - The depot for creating new blocks is also at position `pos-2-0`.

3. **Initial Heights of Blocks:**
   - We assume the heights at all positions are initially zero, as no other heights are specified.

**Goal State Description:**
1. **Desired Heights:**
   - The height of blocks at `pos-2-1` should be 3. This means three blocks should be stacked at this position.
   - The height of blocks at `pos-3-0` should be 3. This indicates three blocks should be stacked at this position.
   
2. **No Unplaced Blocks:**
   - All blocks must be placed correctly, and there should be no blocks left unplaced at the end of the operations.

By following these descriptions, the initial and goal states are clearly defined, ensuring that the planning problem can be addressed accurately within the given domain and constraints.
