No, the two texts do not describe the same problem PDDL. Here are the main differences:

1. Initial Heights:
   - The original description does not specify the initial height of each position. The provided description states that initially, the height of every position on the grid is h1.

2. Height Representation:
   - The original description uses numerical values for heights (e.g., height of 3). The provided description uses symbolic heights (h1, h2, h3) and defines relationships between these heights (h1 is followed by h2, h2 by h3).

3. Height Goals:
   - The original description specifies the goal as having a height of 3 at pos-2-1 and pos-3-0. The provided description specifies these goals using h3 (the highest defined height).

4. Neighbor Relationships:
   - The provided description mentions that each position has defined neighbors (e.g., pos-0-0 is adjacent to pos-0-1 and pos-1-0). This adjacency information is not explicitly stated in the original description.

5. Height Changes:
   - The original description implies that heights change by adding blocks, whereas the provided description defines a sequence of height states (h1, h2, h3).

These differences affect the representation of the problem state and the goals, making the two descriptions distinct from one another.
