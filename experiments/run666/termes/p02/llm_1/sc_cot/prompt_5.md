### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State:**
- The robot's initial position is specified.
- The initial configuration of the grid (positions and heights) is given.
- The depot's position is specified.
- The initial state does not explicitly mention the height of blocks at each position (other than the goal positions), so we can assume they are initially zero unless otherwise stated.

**Goal State:**
- The desired heights at specific positions are specified.
- The heights at other positions should remain unchanged.
- The robot should not have any unplaced blocks at the end.

### Step 2: Describe the Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
1. **Robot Position:**
   - The robot is initially at position `pos-2-0`.

2. **Depot Position:**
   - The depot for new blocks is located at position `pos-2-0`.

3. **Grid Configuration:**
   - The grid consists of 4 rows and 3 columns, comprising the following positions:
     - Row 0: `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`
     - Row 1: `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`
     - Row 2: `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`
     - Row 3: `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`
   - We assume the initial height of blocks at all positions is 0, except where specifically mentioned in the goal state.

4. **Block Handling:**
   - Initially, the robot does not have any blocks.

**Goal State:**
1. **Desired Heights:**
   - The height of blocks at position `pos-2-1` should be 3.
   - The height of blocks at position `pos-3-0` should be 3.

2. **Other Positions:**
   - The heights at other positions should remain unchanged, which we assume to be 0 initially.

3. **Final Robot State:**
   - The robot should not have any unplaced blocks at the end.

### Initial State in Natural Language:

1. The robot is at position `pos-2-0`.
2. The depot for new blocks is also at position `pos-2-0`.
3. The grid consists of positions:
   - `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`
   - `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`
   - `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`
   - `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`
4. Initially, the height of blocks at all positions is 0.
5. The robot does not have any blocks.

### Goal State in Natural Language:

1. The height at position `pos-2-1` should be 3.
2. The height at position `pos-3-0` should be 3.
3. The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged (assumed to be 0).
4. The robot should not have any unplaced blocks at the end.

This natural language description of the initial and goal states provides a clear understanding of the problem setup and desired outcomes.
