To extract the number of objects for each type from the given problem, let's carefully analyze the text.

**Text Analysis:**
- The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, giving us a total of 12 positions.
- Positions are labeled as `pos-<row>-<col>`, so there are 12 unique positions (`pos-0-0` to `pos-3-2`).
- The robot is mentioned, but we are not explicitly counting robots as objects here.
- The depot for new blocks is at `pos-2-0`.
- The maximum height of blocks is 3, but no specific number of blocks is given directly. However, we need to have enough to build the required heights.

**Types Identified from Domain PDDL:**
- **position** (from the grid positions)
- **numb** (numerical values, representing heights, but not explicitly given as objects here)

From the text, we can determine the number of positions (12 in total) but no specific number of `numb` (which are used to represent heights) is given. Instead, the problem specifies that the heights need to be managed, but it does not count heights as individual objects.

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 3  // Since the maximum height of blocks is 3, we assume we need at least numbers 1, 2, and 3.
}
```

This answer reflects the number of unique positions on the grid and the range of height values needed to solve the problem according to the given constraints.
