Here is the feedback based on the specified questions:

1. **Are any necessary objects missing?**
   - No necessary objects are missing.

2. **Are any unnecessary objects included?**
   - No unnecessary objects are included.

3. **Are any objects defined with the wrong type?**
   - No objects are defined with the wrong type.

4. **Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?**
   - No unnecessary or incorrect predicates are declared.

5. **Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?**
   - The initial state does not specify that the robot does not have a block initially. The predicate `(not (has-block))` should be added to the initial state to reflect that the robot starts without a block.

6. **Is anything missing from the goal description?**
   - No, the goal description correctly specifies the desired heights and that no block should be unplaced.

7. **Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?**
   - No, nothing unnecessary is included in the goal description.

8. **Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?**
   - The `NEIGHBOR` predicate is used symmetrically, which is correct.

### Summary:
- Added the predicate `(not (has-block))` to the initial state to reflect that the robot starts without a block.
