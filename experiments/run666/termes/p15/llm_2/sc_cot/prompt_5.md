To clearly explain the initial and goal states, we'll follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State Analysis:**
- The robot is at position `pos-2-0`.
- The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-2-0`.
- The maximum height of blocks is 5, but specific initial heights for all positions are not given, so they can be assumed to be 0 unless stated otherwise.

**Goal State Analysis:**
- The height at `pos-0-2` should be 5.
- The height at `pos-3-0` should be 3.
- The height at `pos-3-2` should be 2.
- Heights at other positions should remain unchanged (assumed to be 0 initially).
- No unplaced block should be present at the end.

### Step 2: Natural Language Descriptions of Connections Between Objects

**Initial State in Natural Language:**
1. The robot is initially located at position `pos-2-0`.
2. The depot for new blocks is also at position `pos-2-0`.
3. All positions on the grid (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`) have an initial height of 0.
4. The robot currently does not possess any blocks.

**Goal State in Natural Language:**
1. The height of blocks at position `pos-0-2` should be 5.
2. The height of blocks at position `pos-3-0` should be 3.
3. The height of blocks at position `pos-3-2` should be 2.
4. The heights at all other positions (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-1`) should remain 0.
5. The robot should not possess any unplaced blocks at the end of the plan.

### Summary

**Initial State:**
- Robot at `pos-2-0`.
- Depot at `pos-2-0`.
- All positions have an initial height of 0.
- Robot does not have any blocks.

**Goal State:**
- Height at `pos-0-2` is 5.
- Height at `pos-3-0` is 3.
- Height at `pos-3-2` is 2.
- Heights at all other positions remain 0.
- No unplaced blocks remain.

These descriptions help clarify the initial setup and the desired outcomes, providing a clear picture of the state transitions required to achieve the goals.
