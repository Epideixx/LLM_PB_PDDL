Based on the provided text, we need to extract the number of objects for each type defined in the domain PDDL (`numb` and `position`). Let's analyze the text to identify these objects.

### Analysis:

**Types:**
1. **position**
   - The grid is described with positions (4 rows and 3 columns), resulting in:
     - `pos-0-0`
     - `pos-0-1`
     - `pos-0-2`
     - `pos-1-0`
     - `pos-1-1`
     - `pos-1-2`
     - `pos-2-0`
     - `pos-2-1`
     - `pos-2-2`
     - `pos-3-0`
     - `pos-3-1`
     - `pos-3-2`
   - Total positions: 12

2. **numb**
   - The maximum height of blocks is specified as 5.
   - We can assume the `numb` type includes numerical values from 1 to 5.
   - Total numerical values: 5

### Collected Objects:

Answer:
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 5
}
```

This gives us the required numbers of objects for each type based on the problem description.
