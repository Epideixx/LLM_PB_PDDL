This PDDL problem definition includes:
- The objects, categorized by their types (`position` and `numb`).
- The initial state, including the robot's starting position, the depot's position, initial heights at all positions, successor relationships for heights, and neighbor relationships for positions.
- The goal state, specifying the target heights at certain positions and ensuring the robot does not hold any block at the end.
