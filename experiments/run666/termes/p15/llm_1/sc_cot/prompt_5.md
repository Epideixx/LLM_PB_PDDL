Sure! Let's break down the initial and goal states as per the provided information.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State:**
1. The robot is at position `pos-2-0`.
2. The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-2-0`.
3. The initial heights at all positions are assumed to be 0 (since not explicitly stated otherwise).

**Goal State:**
1. The height at `pos-0-2` should be 5.
2. The height at `pos-3-0` should be 3.
3. The height at `pos-3-2` should be 2.
4. Heights at other positions should remain unchanged.
5. There should be no unplaced block at the end.

### Step 2: Write in Natural Language the Connections Between the Objects

**Initial State:**
1. The robot is initially located at position `pos-2-0`.
2. Position `pos-2-0` acts as the depot for new blocks, where blocks can be created or destroyed.
3. All positions on the grid (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`) have an initial height of 0.

**Goal State:**
1. The height at position `pos-0-2` should be 5. This means that 5 blocks should be stacked at this position.
2. The height at position `pos-3-0` should be 3. This implies that 3 blocks should be stacked at this position.
3. The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 2. This implies that 2 blocks should be stacked at this position.
4. The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged, meaning they should retain their initial height of 0.
5. The robot should not be holding any block at the end, indicating that all blocks must be placed correctly on the grid.

### Detailed Initial and Goal States:

#### Initial State (Natural Language):
- The robot starts at the position `pos-2-0`.
- The position `pos-2-0` is designated as the depot for creating and destroying blocks.
- All positions on the grid (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`) have an initial height of 0 blocks.

#### Goal State (Natural Language):
- The height at position `pos-0-2` should be 5 blocks.
- The height at position `pos-3-0` should be 3 blocks.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 2 blocks.
- All other positions (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-1`) should maintain their initial height of 0 blocks.
- The robot should not be holding any block at the end, ensuring all blocks are placed correctly.

This clearly defines the initial and goal states in natural language, making it easier to understand the problem requirements and constraints.
