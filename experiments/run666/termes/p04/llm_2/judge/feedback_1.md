No, the two texts do not describe the same problem PDDL. Here are the main differences:

1. **Height Levels Not Mentioned in Original**: The provided description introduces five height levels (h0, h1, h2, h3, and h4) and defines successor relationships between them. The original description does not mention these height levels explicitly.

2. **Initial Heights Not Specified in Original**: The provided description specifies that all positions initially have a height level of h0. The original description does not mention the initial heights of the blocks at the positions.

3. **Neighbor Relationships**: The provided description introduces neighbor relationships between positions, which is not mentioned in the original description. The original problem does not discuss these relationships.

4. **Agent's Final Position**: The provided description specifies that the agent must be at the initial position pos-1-0 in the goal state, which is not mentioned in the original description.

5. **Specificity of Goal State**:
   - The original description aims to build blocks to specific heights at pos-2-0 (height 3) and pos-3-2 (height 4) with no unplaced blocks at the end.
   - The provided description includes these goals but also adds a requirement for the agent's position and the absence of blocks.

These differences indicate that the problem setup and objectives in the provided description contain additional details and constraints not present in the original problem description.
