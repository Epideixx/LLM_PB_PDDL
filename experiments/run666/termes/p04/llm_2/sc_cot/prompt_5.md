### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State:**
- The robot's starting position.
- The height of blocks at each position.
- The presence of the depot.
- The absence or presence of a block with the robot.
- The initial adjacency (neighbor) relationships between positions.

**Goal State:**
- The required heights at specific positions.
- The robot should not have any unplaced blocks.
- The robot's final position may be implied if it needs to place the last block.

### Step 2: Write in Natural Language the Connections Between the Objects

**Initial State:**
1. **Robot Position:**
   - The robot is initially at position `pos-1-0`.

2. **Heights of Positions:**
   - All positions start with an initial height of 0 (assuming no specific heights are mentioned initially).

3. **Depot:**
   - The depot for new blocks is located at position `pos-1-0`.

4. **Block Presence:**
   - The robot does not initially have a block.

5. **Neighbor Relationships:**
   - Positions are adjacent (neighbors) based on their grid layout:
     - `pos-0-0` is adjacent to `pos-0-1` and `pos-1-0`.
     - `pos-0-1` is adjacent to `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-2`, and `pos-1-1`.
     - `pos-0-2` is adjacent to `pos-0-1` and `pos-1-2`.
     - `pos-1-0` is adjacent to `pos-0-0`, `pos-1-1`, and `pos-2-0`.
     - `pos-1-1` is adjacent to `pos-0-1`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-2`, and `pos-2-1`.
     - `pos-1-2` is adjacent to `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-1`, and `pos-2-2`.
     - `pos-2-0` is adjacent to `pos-1-0`, `pos-2-1`, and `pos-3-0`.
     - `pos-2-1` is adjacent to `pos-1-1`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-2`, and `pos-3-1`.
     - `pos-2-2` is adjacent to `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-1`, and `pos-3-2`.
     - `pos-3-0` is adjacent to `pos-2-0` and `pos-3-1`.
     - `pos-3-1` is adjacent to `pos-2-1`, `pos-3-0`, and `pos-3-2`.
     - `pos-3-2` is adjacent to `pos-2-2` and `pos-3-1`.

**Goal State:**
1. **Heights of Specific Positions:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.

2. **Unchanged Heights:**
   - The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged (still 0 if initially 0).

3. **Block Presence:**
   - The robot should not have an unplaced block (i.e., it should not be holding a block at the end).

### Summary of Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
- The robot starts at position `pos-1-0`.
- All positions (`pos-0-0` to `pos-3-2`) have an initial height of 0.
- The depot for new blocks is located at position `pos-1-0`.
- The robot does not initially have a block.
- Positions are adjacent to their immediate neighbors in the grid.

**Goal State:**
- The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.
- The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged (i.e., 0).
- The robot should not be holding a block at the end.

By clearly understanding the initial and goal states, we can accurately formulate the PDDL problem to achieve the desired outcomes within the specified domain.
