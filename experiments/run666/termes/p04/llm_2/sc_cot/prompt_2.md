Based on the given text, let's identify and count the number of objects for each type in the domain.

**Text Analysis:**
- The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, which gives us 12 positions.
- Positions are labeled from `pos-0-0` to `pos-3-2`.
- The depot for new blocks is at `pos-1-0`.
- The robot is initially at `pos-1-0`.
- The maximum height of blocks is 4.
- The goal involves setting specific heights at positions `pos-2-0` and `pos-3-2`.

**Types in the Domain:**
1. **position**: These are the grid positions.
2. **numb**: These represent numerical values, specifically heights.

**Counting Objects:**
- **position**: There are 12 positions: `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`.
- **numb**: Heights mentioned include 3 and 4, but since the maximum height is 4, we should consider all heights from 0 to 4, giving us 5 heights: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`.

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 5
}
```
