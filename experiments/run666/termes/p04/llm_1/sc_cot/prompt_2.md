Based on the given text describing the problem, let's identify and count the number of objects for each type defined in the domain PDDL (`termes` domain).

### Types in the Domain:
1. **numb** - Represents numerical values, likely used for heights.
2. **position** - Represents spatial locations or positions within the environment.

### Extracted Information:
- The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, which implies there are \(4 \times 3 = 12\) positions.
- The maximum height of blocks is 4, which means there are 5 possible heights (0 through 4).

### Objects Count:
- **position**: 12 positions (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`)
- **numb**: 5 possible heights (0 through 4)

### Answer:
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 5
}
```
