### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Lists all positions and numerical values (heights) as objects.
- **Initial State**:
  - The robot starts at `pos-1-0`.
  - All positions initially have a height of 0 (`h0`).
  - Defines `pos-1-0` as the depot for new blocks.
  - Specifies the successor relationships for heights (`SUCC` predicate).
  - Defines neighboring relationships between positions in a 4x3 grid.
- **Goal State**:
  - The height at `pos-2-0` must be 3 (`h3`).
  - The height at `pos-3-2` must be 4 (`h4`).
  - Heights at other positions must remain 0 (`h0`).
  - The robot must not have any unplaced blocks.

This PDDL problem description encapsulates the initial and goal states, along with the necessary relationships and constraints, as derived from the problem text.
