Sure, let's analyze the given problem to determine the initial and goal states, and then describe the relationships between objects for each state.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

**Initial State:**
- The robot is at position `pos-1-0`.
- The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-1-0`.
- The heights at all positions are initially unspecified but assumed to be some default (possibly 0 if not stated otherwise).
- The robot does not have any blocks initially (as nothing is mentioned about it).

**Goal State:**
- The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.
- The heights at other positions should remain unchanged.
- The robot should not have any unplaced blocks at the end.

### Step 2: Describe Connections in Natural Language

**Initial State Connections:**
1. **Robot Location:**
   - The robot is initially located at `pos-1-0`.
   
2. **Depot Location:**
   - The depot for creating or destroying blocks is located at `pos-1-0`.

3. **Heights of Positions:**
   - All positions (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`) are assumed to have an initial height of 0, unless specified otherwise.

4. **Block Possession:**
   - The robot does not possess any blocks initially.

**Goal State Connections:**
1. **Height Requirements:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3 blocks high.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4 blocks high.
   
2. **Unchanged Heights:**
   - The heights at other positions (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`) should remain at their initial values (assumed to be 0).

3. **Block Possession:**
   - The robot should not have any unplaced blocks by the end of the task (indicating all created blocks should be placed at the appropriate positions).

### Summary:

**Initial State (Natural Language):**
- The robot is at position `pos-1-0`, which is also the depot for creating or destroying blocks.
- All positions in the grid have an initial height of 0.
- The robot does not have any blocks initially.

**Goal State (Natural Language):**
- The height at position `pos-2-0` must be 3 blocks high.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` must be 4 blocks high.
- The heights at all other positions must remain unchanged (assumed to be 0).
- The robot should not possess any unplaced blocks at the end of the task.

With these descriptions, the initial and goal states are clearly defined, setting the stage for formulating the PDDL problem.
