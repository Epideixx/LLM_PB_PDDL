Based on the given problem description and the types defined in the domain PDDL, we can extract the names of each object.

### Problem Breakdown:

- **Position**: The grid is defined with 4 rows and 3 columns, resulting in 12 positions.
  - Positions: pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2, pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2, pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2, pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2

- **Numb**: The problem mentions that the maximum height of blocks is 4, which implies there are 5 possible height values (0 through 4).
  - Numb values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

### Answer:

```json
{
  "position": ["pos-0-0", "pos-0-1", "pos-0-2", "pos-1-0", "pos-1-1", "pos-1-2", "pos-2-0", "pos-2-1", "pos-2-2", "pos-3-0", "pos-3-1", "pos-3-2"],
  "numb": ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]
}
```

This breakdown accurately reflects the names of each object for the types as inferred from the problem description.
