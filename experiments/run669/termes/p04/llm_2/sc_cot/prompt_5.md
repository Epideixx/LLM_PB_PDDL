To explain clearly the initial and goal states, let's break down the problem into the relevant components and describe the connections between the objects.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

**Initial State:**
- The robot starts at position `pos-1-0`.
- The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-1-0`.
- The initial heights of all positions are assumed to be zero unless specified otherwise.
- The robot does not have any blocks initially.

**Goal State:**
- The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.
- The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged (assumed to be zero initially).
- The robot should not have any blocks in hand at the end.

### Step 2: Describe the Connections Between Objects in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
1. **Robot Position:**
   - The robot is initially located at position `pos-1-0`.

2. **Depot:**
   - The depot for new blocks is located at position `pos-1-0`.

3. **Position Heights:**
   - The initial height of all positions (`pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`) is zero.

4. **Robot Block Status:**
   - The robot does not have any blocks initially.

**Goal State:**
1. **Robot Block Status:**
   - The robot should not have any blocks in hand at the end.

2. **Position Heights:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.
   - The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged from their initial state (zero).

### Summary in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
- The robot starts at position `pos-1-0`.
- There is a depot for new blocks at position `pos-1-0`.
- All positions on the grid (pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2, pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2, pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2, pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2) have an initial height of zero.
- The robot does not initially have any blocks.

**Goal State:**
- The robot should not have any blocks in hand at the end.
- The height at position `pos-2-0` should be increased to 3.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be increased to 4.
- The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged from their initial state (zero).

By understanding these connections, we can accurately define the initial and goal states for the given problem in the context of the provided domain PDDL.
