Based on the given problem description and the types defined in the domain PDDL, we can extract the number of objects for each type.

### Problem Breakdown:

- **Position**: The grid is defined with 4 rows and 3 columns. This results in \(4 \times 3 = 12\) positions.
  - Positions: pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2, pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2, pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2, pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2

- **Numb**: The problem mentions that the maximum height of blocks is 4, which implies there are 5 possible height values (0 through 4).
  - Numb values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

### Answer:

```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 5
}
```

This breakdown accurately reflects the number of objects for each type as inferred from the problem description.
