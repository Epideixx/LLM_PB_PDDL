To determine the number of objects for each type, we should parse the given text and identify the objects that belong to the types defined in the domain PDDL.

### Types in the Domain
- **numb:** Represents numerical values.
- **position:** Represents locations within the environment.

### Parsing the Text
Let's extract the objects and their counts:

1. **Positions:**
   - The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, which means there are \(4 \times 3 = 12\) positions.
   - Positions are listed explicitly:
     - `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`
     - `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`
     - `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`
     - `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`
   - Total positions: 12

2. **Numbers:**
   - The text mentions the maximum height of blocks is 4. This implies numbers from 0 to 4 are relevant.
   - Total numbers: 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

### Answer
Based on the extracted information, the counts for each type are:

```json
{
    "position": 12,
    "numb": 5
}
```
