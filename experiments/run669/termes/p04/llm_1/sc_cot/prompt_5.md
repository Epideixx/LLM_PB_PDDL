Let's break down the problem into initial and goal states.

### Step 1: Analyze What Belongs to the Initial State and What Belongs to the Goal State

#### Initial State
Based on the provided text, the initial state includes:
1. The robot's initial position.
2. The depot's position for new blocks.
3. The initial heights of all positions in the grid.
4. The maximum allowed height of blocks.

#### Goal State
The goal state includes:
1. Specific heights at given positions.
2. Condition that the heights at other positions remain unchanged.
3. Condition that no unplaced block remains at the end.

### Step 2: Describe the Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

#### Initial State Description
1. **Robot's Position:**
   - The robot is initially at position `pos-1-0`.

2. **Depot Position:**
   - The depot for new blocks is located at position `pos-1-0`.

3. **Positions and Heights:**
   - The grid consists of the following positions:
     - `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`
     - `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`
     - `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`
     - `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`
   - The initial heights at all positions are not explicitly stated, so we assume they are initially zero unless specified otherwise.

4. **Maximum Height:**
   - The maximum height of blocks at any position is 4.

#### Goal State Description
1. **Specific Heights at Given Positions:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.

2. **Heights at Other Positions:**
   - The heights at the other positions should remain unchanged from their initial state.

3. **No Unplaced Blocks:**
   - At the end, there should be no unplaced blocks, meaning the robot should not hold any block.

### Initial State Connections
1. **Robot at Initial Position:**
   - The robot is located at `pos-1-0`.

2. **Depot Location:**
   - `pos-1-0` serves as the depot for creating new blocks.

3. **Grid and Initial Heights:**
   - The positions on the grid are as follows:
     - `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`
     - `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`
     - `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`
     - `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`
   - Initial heights are assumed to be zero unless otherwise indicated.

### Goal State Connections
1. **Height at `pos-2-0`:**
   - The height at `pos-2-0` should be 3.

2. **Height at `pos-3-2`:**
   - The height at `pos-3-2` should be 4.

3. **Heights at Other Positions:**
   - The heights at all other positions should remain as they were initially (assumed to be zero if not specified).

4. **No Unplaced Blocks:**
   - The robot should not be holding any block at the end of the task.

### Summary of Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State
- The robot is at `pos-1-0`.
- `pos-1-0` is the depot for new blocks.
- The grid includes positions: `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`.
- The initial heights are zero for all positions unless specified.
- The maximum height of blocks is 4.

#### Goal State
- The height at `pos-2-0` should be 3.
- The height at `pos-3-2` should be 4.
- Heights at other positions should remain unchanged.
- No unplaced blocks should remain at the end.
