Sure, let's write the PDDL problem definition based on the provided text and all the previous information.

```pddl
(define (problem termes_problem) 
   (:domain termes)
   (:objects 
       pos-0-0 pos-0-1 pos-0-2 
       pos-1-0 pos-1-1 pos-1-2 
       pos-2-0 pos-2-1 pos-2-2 
       pos-3-0 pos-3-1 pos-3-2 - position
       h0 h1 h2 h3 h4 - numb
   )
   (:init 
       ;; Initial positions of the robot and the depot
       (at pos-1-0)
       (IS-DEPOT pos-1-0)

       ;; Initial heights of all positions (assuming they start at height 0)
       (height pos-0-0 h0)
       (height pos-0-1 h0)
       (height pos-0-2 h0)
       (height pos-1-0 h0)
       (height pos-1-1 h0)
       (height pos-1-2 h0)
       (height pos-2-0 h0)
       (height pos-2-1 h0)
       (height pos-2-2 h0)
       (height pos-3-0 h0)
       (height pos-3-1 h0)
       (height pos-3-2 h0)
       
       ;; Successor relationships between heights
       (SUCC h0 h1)
       (SUCC h1 h2)
       (SUCC h2 h3)
       (SUCC h3 h4)
       
       ;; Neighbor relationships between positions
       (NEIGHBOR pos-0-0 pos-0-1)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-0-1 pos-0-2)

       (NEIGHBOR pos-3-1 pos-3-2)
       
       (NEIGHBOR pos-0-0 pos-1-0)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-0-1 pos-1-1)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-0-2 pos-1-2)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-1-0 pos-2-0)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-1-1 pos-2-1)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-1-2 pos-2-2)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-2-0 pos-3-0)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-2-1 pos-3-1)
       (NEIGHBOR pos-2-2 pos-3-2)
   )
   (:goal 
       (and
           ;; Goal heights at specific positions
           (height pos-2-0 h3)
           (height pos-3-2 h4)
           
           ;; Ensure no unplaced block remains
           (not (has-block))
       )
   )
)
```

### Explanation

1. **Objects:**
   - Positions: All grid positions are listed as objects of type `position`.
   - Heights: Numerical values are represented as `h0`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and `h4` of type `numb`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - The robot starts at `pos-1-0`.
   - `pos-1-0` is marked as a depot.
   - Initial heights of all positions are assumed to be zero (`h0`).
   - Successor relationships between heights are defined.
   - Neighbor relationships between positions are defined to reflect the grid structure.

3. **Goal State:**
   - The height at `pos-2-0` should be `h3` (height 3).
   - The height at `pos-3-2` should be `h4` (height 4).
   - The robot should not have any unplaced block.

This PDDL problem definition captures the initial conditions and the goal state while respecting the constraints and rules provided in the domain and problem descriptions.
