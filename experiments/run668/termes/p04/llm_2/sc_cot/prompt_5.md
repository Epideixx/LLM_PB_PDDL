Sure! Let's break down the problem by analyzing the initial state and the goal state, and then describe the connections between objects for each state.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:
- The robot is at position `pos-1-0`.
- The depot for new blocks is at `pos-1-0`.
- The heights at all positions are initially unspecified, but we assume they start at 0 unless otherwise stated.
- The robot does not initially have a block.

#### Goal State:
- The robot must build blocks so that:
  - The height at `pos-2-0` is 3.
  - The height at `pos-3-2` is 4.
  - The heights at other positions remain unchanged (assumed to be 0 if not specified).
- The robot cannot have an unplaced block at the end, meaning all blocks must be placed according to the height goals.

### Step 2: Describe Connections in Natural Language

#### Initial State (Natural Language Description):
1. **Robot Position:**
   - The robot is initially located at position `pos-1-0`.

2. **Depot:**
   - The depot for creating and destroying blocks is located at position `pos-1-0`.

3. **Heights:**
   - All positions on the grid (`pos-0-0` to `pos-3-2`) are initially at height 0.
   - This includes the following positions: 
     - `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`
     - `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`
     - `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`
     - `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`

4. **Block Possession:**
   - The robot does not initially possess any block.

#### Goal State (Natural Language Description):
1. **Robot Position:**
   - The final position of the robot is not specified as a goal, so it can be anywhere on the grid.

2. **Heights:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` must be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` must be 4.
   - Heights at all other positions must remain unchanged (assumed to be 0).

3. **Block Placement:**
   - All blocks must be correctly placed to achieve the specified heights.
   - There should be no unplaced blocks at the end.

4. **Block Possession:**
   - The robot must not possess any block at the end.

### Summary of Initial and Goal States:

#### Initial State:
- **Robot Position:** The robot is at `pos-1-0`.
- **Depot:** Located at `pos-1-0`.
- **Heights:** All positions start at height 0.
- **Block Possession:** The robot does not have a block.

#### Goal State:
- **Height at `pos-2-0`:** Must be 3.
- **Height at `pos-3-2`:** Must be 4.
- **Heights at Other Positions:** Remain unchanged (assumed to be 0).
- **Block Placement:** All blocks must be placed correctly with no unplaced blocks.
- **Block Possession:** The robot must not have a block.

This should clearly outline the initial and goal states, providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem context. If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!
