Based on the provided problem text, let's extract the names of each object for the types defined in the domain PDDL.

**Types and Objects:**

1. **position:**
   - The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, resulting in a total of 12 positions.
   - Listed positions: pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2, pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2, pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2, pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2.

2. **numb:**
   - The text mentions heights, with the maximum height of blocks being 4.
   - This implies we have numerical values representing heights: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "position": ["pos-0-0", "pos-0-1", "pos-0-2", "pos-1-0", "pos-1-1", "pos-1-2", "pos-2-0", "pos-2-1", "pos-2-2", "pos-3-0", "pos-3-1", "pos-3-2"],
  "numb": ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]
}
```

This should correctly represent the names of each object within the given problem context. If you need further assistance or have additional questions, feel free to ask!
