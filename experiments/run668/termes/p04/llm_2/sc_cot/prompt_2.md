Based on the provided problem text, let's extract the number of objects for each type as per the previously defined domain PDDL.

**Types:**
1. **position**
2. **numb**

**Extracting Objects:**

- **position:**
  - The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, resulting in a total of 12 positions.
  - Listed positions: pos-0-0, pos-0-1, pos-0-2, pos-1-0, pos-1-1, pos-1-2, pos-2-0, pos-2-1, pos-2-2, pos-3-0, pos-3-1, pos-3-2.
  - Number of positions: 12

- **numb:**
  - The text mentions heights, with the maximum height of blocks being 4.
  - This implies we have numerical values representing heights: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - Number of numb: 5

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 5
}
```

This should correctly represent the number of objects for each type within the given problem context. If you need further assistance or have additional questions, feel free to ask!
