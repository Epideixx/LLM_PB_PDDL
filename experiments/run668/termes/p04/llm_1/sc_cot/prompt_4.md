Given the domain and problem, we need to establish a set of rules that the agent (robot) must follow to achieve the goal. These rules will ensure that the actions taken are valid within the constraints and requirements of the domain.

### Rules to Follow:

1. **Initial Position and Depot Constraints:**
   - The robot starts at position `pos-1-0`, which is also the depot for new blocks.

2. **Maximum Height Constraint:**
   - The height of blocks at any position cannot exceed 4.

3. **Movement Rules:**
   - The robot can move to neighboring positions only.
   - While moving, the robot must update its position accordingly.
   - The robot can move up or down one height level, but only if it follows the successor relationship.

4. **Block Placement and Removal:**
   - The robot can place a block if it has one and the new height is the successor of the current height.
   - The robot can remove a block if it does not have one and the new height is the predecessor of the current height.
   - Blocks can only be created or destroyed at the depot (`pos-1-0`).

5. **Goal Constraints:**
   - The height at `pos-2-0` must be 3.
   - The height at `pos-3-2` must be 4.
   - Heights at other positions must remain unchanged.
   - There should not be any unplaced blocks at the end.

6. **Action Preconditions and Effects:**
   - Each action must meet its preconditions to be executable.
   - The effects of each action must be correctly applied to maintain the state consistency.

### Summary of Actions:
- **move**: Move the robot from one position to a neighboring position at the same height.
- **move-up**: Move the robot to a neighboring position at one level higher.
- **move-down**: Move the robot to a neighboring position at one level lower.
- **place-block**: Place a block at a neighboring position, increasing its height.
- **remove-block**: Remove a block from a neighboring position, decreasing its height.
- **create-block**: Create a new block at the depot if the robot does not have one.
- **destroy-block**: Destroy the block at the depot if the robot has one.

### Detailed Rules:

1. **Initial State Rules:**
   - `(at pos-1-0)`
   - `(height pos-2-0 0)`
   - `(height pos-3-2 0)`
   - `(IS-DEPOT pos-1-0)`

2. **Movement Rules:**
   - **move**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?from)`, `(NEIGHBOR ?from ?to)`, `(height ?from ?h)`, `(height ?to ?h)`
     - Effect: `(not (at ?from))`, `(at ?to)`

   - **move-up**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?from)`, `(NEIGHBOR ?from ?to)`, `(height ?from ?hfrom)`, `(height ?to ?hto)`, `(SUCC ?hto ?hfrom)`
     - Effect: `(not (at ?from))`, `(at ?to)`

   - **move-down**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?from)`, `(NEIGHBOR ?from ?to)`, `(height ?from ?hfrom)`, `(height ?to ?hto)`, `(SUCC ?hfrom ?hto)`
     - Effect: `(not (at ?from))`, `(at ?to)`

3. **Block Handling Rules:**
   - **place-block**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?rpos)`, `(NEIGHBOR ?rpos ?bpos)`, `(height ?rpos ?hbefore)`, `(height ?bpos ?hbefore)`, `(SUCC ?hafter ?hbefore)`, `(has-block)`, `(not (IS-DEPOT ?bpos))`
     - Effect: `(not (height ?bpos ?hbefore))`, `(height ?bpos ?hafter)`, `(not (has-block))`

   - **remove-block**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?rpos)`, `(NEIGHBOR ?rpos ?bpos)`, `(height ?rpos ?hafter)`, `(height ?bpos ?hbefore)`, `(SUCC ?hbefore ?hafter)`, `(not (has-block))`
     - Effect: `(not (height ?bpos ?hbefore))`, `(height ?bpos ?hafter)`, `(has-block)`

   - **create-block**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?p)`, `(not (has-block))`, `(IS-DEPOT ?p)`
     - Effect: `(has-block)`

   - **destroy-block**:
     - Precondition: `(at ?p)`, `(has-block)`, `(IS-DEPOT ?p)`
     - Effect: `(not (has-block))`

By adhering to these rules, the robot can effectively navigate the grid, manipulate blocks, and achieve the specified goal while maintaining the integrity of the environment and satisfying all constraints.
