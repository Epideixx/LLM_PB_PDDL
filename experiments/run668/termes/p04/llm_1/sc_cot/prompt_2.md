To extract the number of objects for each type from the provided problem text, let's identify the objects and their types based on the domain PDDL we previously analyzed.

### Problem Text Analysis:
- The grid consists of 4 rows and 3 columns, resulting in a total of 12 positions.
- Specific positions are mentioned: `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`.
- `pos-1-0` is the depot.
- The robot is initially at `pos-1-0`.
- The maximum height of blocks is 4, indicating possible height values from 0 to 4.

### Object Types in Domain PDDL:
1. **position**
2. **numb** 

### Objects for Each Type:
- **position**: There are 12 unique positions in the grid.
- **numb**: The problem mentions heights ranging from 0 to 4, so there are 5 unique numerical values representing heights.

### Answer:
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 5
}
```

This accurately reflects the number of distinct objects for each type based on the provided problem text and the domain PDDL.
