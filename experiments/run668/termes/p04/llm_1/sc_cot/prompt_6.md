### Explanation:

- **Objects:**
  - Positions: All positions on the grid are listed and typed as `position`.
  - Heights: Heights are represented by `h0` to `h4` and typed as `numb`.

- **Initial State:**
  - The robot starts at `pos-1-0`, which is also the depot.
  - All positions are initialized with a height of `h0`.
  - Successor relationships are defined for numeric values representing heights.
  - Neighbor relationships for the grid positions are established.

- **Goal State:**
  - The height at `pos-2-0` must be `h3`.
  - The height at `pos-3-2` must be `h4`.
  - Heights at all other positions remain unchanged (`h0`).
  - The robot should not have any unplaced blocks at the end (`not (has-block)`).
