### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

**Initial State:**
- The robot's starting position.
- The initial heights of all positions.
- The depot for new blocks.
- Any other initial conditions specified.

**Goal State:**
- The required heights at specific positions.
- The condition that no unplaced blocks should remain.
- The condition that heights at other positions should remain unchanged.

### Step 2: Describe Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

**Initial State:**
1. **Robot's Position:**
   - The robot is at position `pos-1-0`.

2. **Initial Heights:**
   - All positions, unless otherwise specified, have an initial height of 0.
   - Position `pos-2-0` has an initial height of 0.
   - Position `pos-3-2` has an initial height of 0.

3. **Depot:**
   - Position `pos-1-0` is designated as the depot for new blocks.

4. **Blocks:**
   - The robot does not initially possess any blocks.

**Goal State:**
1. **Height Requirements:**
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` must be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` must be 4.

2. **Unchanged Heights:**
   - The heights at all other positions must remain unchanged from their initial state (0 in this case).

3. **Block Conditions:**
   - There should be no unplaced blocks at the end.

### Natural Language Description:

**Initial State:**
- The robot starts at the position `pos-1-0`, which is also identified as the depot for new blocks.
- All positions on the grid initially have a height of 0. This includes specific mentions that both `pos-2-0` and `pos-3-2` start with a height of 0.
- The robot does not have any blocks at the beginning.

**Goal State:**
- The robot must ensure that the height of blocks at position `pos-2-0` is exactly 3.
- The height of blocks at position `pos-3-2` must be exactly 4.
- The heights at all other positions should remain at their initial value of 0.
- By the end of the task, the robot should not have any unplaced blocks, meaning all blocks must be properly placed on the grid as required.

This provides a clear understanding of the initial setup and the desired outcome, ensuring that the robot can plan its actions to achieve the specified goals while adhering to the rules and constraints of the domain.
