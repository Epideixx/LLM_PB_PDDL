Given the problem description, we need to identify the number of objects for each type in the `blocksworld-4ops` domain. Since the provided domain only has one implicit type, `object`, and the problem only mentions blocks, we can categorize everything under the type `block`.

### Analysis of the Text

- "You have 5 blocks."
  - This indicates there are 5 block objects.

- Specific block positions and conditions:
  - b4 is on top of b1.
  - b2 is on top of b3.
  - b3 is on top of b5.
  - b1 is on top of b2.
  - b5 is on the table.
  - b4 is clear.
  - Your arm is empty.

From the text, we can infer that all mentioned objects are blocks, and there are no other types of objects involved.

### Answer

```json
{
  "block": 5
}
```

This breakdown confirms that there are 5 blocks in the problem statement.
