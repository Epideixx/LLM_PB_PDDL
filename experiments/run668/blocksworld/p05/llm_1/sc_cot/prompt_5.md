Sure, let's break down the initial and goal states by analyzing the given problem description.

### Step 1: Analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state

**Initial State:**
- b4 is on top of b1.
- b2 is on top of b3.
- b3 is on top of b5.
- b1 is on top of b2.
- b5 is on the table.
- b4 is clear.
- Your arm is empty.

**Goal State:**
- b1 should be on top of b3.
- b3 should be on top of b5.

### Step 2: Write in natural language the connections between the objects

**Initial State:**
1. **b4 is on top of b1:**
   - Block b4 is directly placed on top of block b1.
2. **b2 is on top of b3:**
   - Block b2 is directly placed on top of block b3.
3. **b3 is on top of b5:**
   - Block b3 is directly placed on top of block b5.
4. **b1 is on top of b2:**
   - Block b1 is directly placed on top of block b2.
5. **b5 is on the table:**
   - Block b5 is directly on the table, not on any other block.
6. **b4 is clear:**
   - Block b4 has no other block on top of it.
7. **Your arm is empty:**
   - The robotic arm is not holding any block.

**Goal State:**
1. **b1 should be on top of b3:**
   - Block b1 needs to be directly placed on top of block b3.
2. **b3 should be on top of b5:**
   - Block b3 needs to be directly placed on top of block b5.

### Summary in Natural Language

#### Initial State:
1. Block b4 is placed on top of block b1.
2. Block b2 is placed on top of block b3.
3. Block b3 is placed on top of block b5.
4. Block b1 is placed on top of block b2.
5. Block b5 is on the table.
6. Block b4 is clear, meaning no block is on top of b4.
7. The robotic arm is empty, not holding any block.

#### Goal State:
1. Block b1 needs to be placed on top of block b3.
2. Block b3 needs to be placed on top of block b5.

This breakdown should help in clearly understanding the initial and goal states in the context of the `blocksworld-4ops` domain.
