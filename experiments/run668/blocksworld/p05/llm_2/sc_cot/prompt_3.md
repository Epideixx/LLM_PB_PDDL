Based on the provided text, we need to extract the names of each object involved in the problem. Since the domain primarily deals with blocks, we'll focus on identifying the names of these blocks.

### Problem Text:
- You have 5 blocks.
- b4 is on top of b1.
- b2 is on top of b3.
- b3 is on top of b5.
- b1 is on top of b2.
- b5 is on the table.
- b4 is clear.
- Your arm is empty.
- Your goal is to move the blocks.
- b1 should be on top of b3.
- b3 should be on top of b5.

### Answer:
```
