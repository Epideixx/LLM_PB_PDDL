Certainly! Below is the complete PDDL problem formulation based on the provided text and the domain rules we discussed earlier.

```pddl
(define (problem blocksworld-problem)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5)  ;; List of blocks
  
  (:init 
    (clear b4)               ;; b4 is clear
    (on b4 b1)               ;; b4 is on top of b1
    (on b2 b3)               ;; b2 is on top of b3
    (on b3 b5)               ;; b3 is on top of b5
    (on b1 b2)               ;; b1 is on top of b2
    (on-table b5)            ;; b5 is on the table
    (arm-empty)              ;; The arm is empty
  )
  
  (:goal 
    (and 
      (on b1 b3)             ;; b1 should be on top of b3
      (on b3 b5)             ;; b3 should be on top of b5
    )
  )
)
```

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** We define the blocks `b1`, `b2`, `b3`, `b4`, and `b5`.
- **Initial State:**
  - `clear b4`: Block `b4` is clear (no block on top).
  - `on b4 b1`: Block `b4` is on top of block `b1`.
  - `on b2 b3`: Block `b2` is on top of block `b3`.
  - `on b3 b5`: Block `b3` is on top of block `b5`.
  - `on b1 b2`: Block `b1` is on top of block `b2`.
  - `on-table b5`: Block `b5` is on the table.
  - `arm-empty`: The robotic arm is empty.
- **Goal State:**
  - `on b1 b3`: Block `b1` should be on top of block `b3`.
  - `on b3 b5`: Block `b3` should be on top of block `b5`.

This PDDL formulation captures the initial conditions of the blocks and the goal conditions that need to be achieved.
