Let's break down the initial and goal states as described in the problem text. We will follow the steps to analyze and clearly articulate the relationships between the objects in both states.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:
- b5 is on the table.
- b4 is clear.
- Your arm is empty.
- b4 is on top of b1.
- b2 is on top of b3.
- b3 is on top of b5.
- b1 is on top of b2.

#### Goal State:
- b1 should be on top of b3.
- b3 should be on top of b5.

### Step 2: Describe the Initial and Goal States in Natural Language

#### Initial State:
1. **b5 is on the table:** Block b5 is directly on the table surface.
2. **b4 is clear:** There is no block on top of block b4.
3. **Your arm is empty:** The robotic arm is not holding any block.
4. **b4 is on top of b1:** Block b4 is placed directly on top of block b1.
5. **b2 is on top of b3:** Block b2 is placed directly on top of block b3.
6. **b3 is on top of b5:** Block b3 is placed directly on top of block b5.
7. **b1 is on top of b2:** Block b1 is placed directly on top of block b2.

#### Goal State:
1. **b1 should be on top of b3:** Block b1 is required to be placed directly on top of block b3.
2. **b3 should be on top of b5:** Block b3 is required to be placed directly on top of block b5.

### Summary

To solve the problem, we need to transition from the initial state to the goal state by manipulating the blocks according to the domain's rules and actions. Specifically, we need to move the blocks such that in the end, block b1 is on top of block b3, and block b3 is on top of block b5.
