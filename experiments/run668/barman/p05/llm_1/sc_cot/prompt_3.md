To extract the names of each object from the given problem, let's break down the information provided:

- 1 shaker
- 3 levels
- 5 shot glasses
- 3 dispensers
- 3 ingredients
- The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Your left and right hands are empty.
- There are 4 cocktails (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4).
- shot1 contains cocktail1
- shot2 contains cocktail4
- shot3 contains cocktail3
- shot4 contains cocktail2

Now let's compile the object names by type:

1. **hand**
   - Objects: [left, right]

2. **level**
   - Objects: [level1, level2, level3]

3. **beverage**
   - Objects: [cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4]

4. **dispenser**
   - Objects: [dispenser1, dispenser2, dispenser3]

5. **container**
   - Objects: [shaker1, shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5]

6. **ingredient**
   - Objects: [ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3]

7. **cocktail**
   - Objects: [cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4]

8. **shot**
   - Objects: [shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5]

9. **shaker**
   - Objects: [shaker1]

Now let's compile this information into the answer:

Answer:
```json
{
  "hand": ["left", "right"],
  "level": ["level1", "level2", "level3"],
  "beverage": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
  "dispenser": ["dispenser1", "dispenser2", "dispenser3"],
  "container": ["shaker1", "shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4", "shot5"],
  "ingredient": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
  "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
  "shot": ["shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4", "shot5"],
  "shaker": ["shaker1"]
}
```
