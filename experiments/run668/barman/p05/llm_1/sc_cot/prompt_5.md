   - 1 shaker
   - 3 levels
   - 5 shot glasses
   - 3 dispensers
   - 3 ingredients
   - 4 cocktails
   - 2 hands

2. **Properties and Predicates:**

   - The shaker and shot glasses are on the table.
   - Both hands (left and right) are empty.
   - The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2.
   - The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1.
   - The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1.
   - The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2.
   - The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1.
   - The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3.
   - The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3.
   - The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2.

#### Goal State
1. **Goal:**
   - The goal is to make 4 cocktails:
     - shot1 contains cocktail1.
     - shot2 contains cocktail4.
     - shot3 contains cocktail3.
     - shot4 contains cocktail2.

### Step 2: Write in Natural Language the Connections Between Objects

#### Initial State

1. **Cleanliness and Emptiness:**
   - The shaker (shaker1) is clean and empty.
   - The shot glasses (shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5) are clean and empty.

2. **Location:**
   - The shaker (shaker1) is on the table.
   - The shot glasses (shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5) are on the table.

3. **Hands:**
   - The left hand is empty.
   - The right hand is empty.

4. **Cocktail Ingredients:**
   - Cocktail1 is made up of ingredient2 and ingredient1.
   - Cocktail2 is made up of ingredient1 and ingredient2.
   - Cocktail3 is made up of ingredient1 and ingredient3.
   - Cocktail4 is made up of ingredient3 and ingredient2.

#### Goal State

1. **Cocktail Assignment to Shot Glasses:**
   - Shot glass (shot1) contains cocktail1.
   - Shot glass (shot2) contains cocktail4.
   - Shot glass (shot3) contains cocktail3.
   - Shot glass (shot4) contains cocktail2.
