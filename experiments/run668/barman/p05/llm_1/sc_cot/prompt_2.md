To determine the number of objects for each type in the given problem, let's break down the information provided:

- 1 shaker
- 3 levels
- 5 shot glasses
- 3 dispensers
- 3 ingredients
- The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Your left and right hands are empty.
- There are 4 cocktails (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4).

Now, based on the types defined in the domain:

1. **hand**
   - Number of hands: 2 (left and right hands)

2. **level**
   - Number of levels: 3

3. **beverage**
   - Number of beverages: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)

4. **dispenser**
   - Number of dispensers: 3

5. **container**
   - Number of containers: 6 (1 shaker + 5 shot glasses)

6. **ingredient**
   - Number of ingredients: 3

7. **cocktail**
   - Number of cocktails: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)

8. **shot**
   - Number of shots: 5 (since shot is a subtype of container, it's already counted in container)

9. **shaker**
   - Number of shakers: 1 (since shaker is a subtype of container, it's already counted in container)

Now let's compile this information into the answer:

Answer:
```json
{
  "hand": 2,
  "level": 3,
  "beverage": 4,
  "dispenser": 3,
  "container": 6,
  "ingredient": 3,
  "cocktail": 4,
  "shot": 5,
  "shaker": 1
}
```

Note: Since "shot" and "shaker" are subtypes of "container," the count for "container" already includes them.
