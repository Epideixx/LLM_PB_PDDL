To create and think about rules in the domain based on the problem, we need to consider the actions and constraints provided by the PDDL domain and the specific goals mentioned in the problem. Here are some rules and guidelines to follow:

### General Rules:

1. **Initial State Constraints:**
   - All shot glasses and the shaker are clean and empty.
   - Both hands (left and right) are empty.
   - All containers (shot glasses and the shaker) are on the table.

2. **Ingredient and Cocktail Relationships:**
   - Each cocktail is composed of specific ingredients (e.g., cocktail1 consists of ingredient2 and ingredient1).

3. **Action-Based Rules:**
   - **Grasp:** A hand can grasp a container only if the container is on the table and the hand is empty.
   - **Leave:** A hand can leave a container on the table only if it is holding the container.
   - **Fill-Shot:** A shot glass can be filled with an ingredient from a dispenser only if the shot glass is empty, clean, and a hand is holding it.
   - **Refill-Shot:** A shot glass can be refilled with an ingredient from a dispenser if it is empty and has been previously used to contain the same ingredient.
   - **Empty-Shot:** A shot glass can be emptied only if it is currently holding a beverage and a hand is holding it.
   - **Clean-Shot:** A shot glass can be cleaned if it is empty and has been previously used.
   - **Pour-Shot-to-Clean-Shaker:** Pouring from a shot glass to a shaker can be done if the shaker is clean, empty, and the shot glass contains an ingredient.
   - **Pour-Shot-to-Used-Shaker:** Pouring from a shot glass to a used shaker can be done if the shaker is unshaked and contains an ingredient.
   - **Empty-Shaker:** A shaker can be emptied if it contains a cocktail, is shaked, and a hand is holding it.
   - **Clean-Shaker:** A shaker can be cleaned if it is empty and a hand is holding it.
   - **Shake:** A shaker can be shaken to create a cocktail if it contains the required ingredients.
   - **Pour-Shaker-to-Shot:** A cocktail can be poured from a shaker to a shot glass if the shot glass is clean and empty.

4. **Goal Constraints:**
   - The goal is to make 4 cocktails:
     - shot1 should contain cocktail1.
     - shot2 should contain cocktail4.
     - shot3 should contain cocktail3.
     - shot4 should contain cocktail2.

### Specific Rules:

1. **For Grasping Containers:**
   - A hand must be empty to grasp a container.
   - The container must be on the table to be grasped.

2. **For Leaving Containers:**
   - A container must be held by a hand to be left on the table.
   - Once left, the container is on the table, and the hand is empty.

3. **For Filling Shot Glasses:**
   - A shot glass must be held by a hand, empty, and clean to be filled from a dispenser.
   - The dispenser must dispense the required ingredient.

4. **For Refilling Shot Glasses:**
   - The shot glass must have been previously used for the same ingredient and must be empty and held by a hand.

5. **For Emptying Shot Glasses:**
   - The shot glass must contain a beverage and must be held by a hand to be emptied.

6. **For Cleaning Shot Glasses:**
   - The shot glass must be empty and held by a hand and must have been used previously.

7. **For Pouring Shot Glass to Shaker:**
   - The shaker must be clean and empty or unshaked and used.
   - The shot glass must contain an ingredient and be held by a hand.

8. **For Emptying Shakers:**
   - The shaker must contain a cocktail and be shaked, and a hand must be holding it.

9. **For Cleaning Shakers:**
   - The shaker must be empty and held by a hand.

10. **For Shaking Ingredients in Shakers:**
    - The shaker must contain the required ingredients for the cocktail.

11. **For Pouring Shaker to Shot Glass:**
    - The shot glass must be clean and empty.
    - The shaker must contain the cocktail and be shaked.

### Conclusion:

By following these rules, we ensure that all actions performed within the domain are valid and lead to a state where the goal conditions are met. This structured approach will help in formulating a valid problem PDDL that aligns with the domain constraints and achieves the desired goals.
