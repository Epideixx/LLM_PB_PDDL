system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain barman)

This information provides a deeper understanding of the domain, summarizing the types and predicates used.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Using your understanding of the domain, you will now have to understand a problem, formulated in natural language, which is associated with the previous domain PDDL. Your first mission is to collect the number of objects for each type. 

To guide you, I will provide you with an example which belongs to another domain.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’table’: 2, ’apple’: 4, ’orange’: 3, ’plate’: 5, ’ball’: 3, ’kid’: 3, ’cell’: 8}

Now it is your turn, for the following problem:
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2. 

Answer:


--------------------------------------------------

assistant : To determine the number of objects for each type in the given problem, let's break down the information provided:

- 1 shaker
- 3 levels
- 5 shot glasses
- 3 dispensers
- 3 ingredients
- The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Your left and right hands are empty.
- There are 4 cocktails (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4).

Now, based on the types defined in the domain:

1. **hand**
   - Number of hands: 2 (left and right hands)

2. **level**
   - Number of levels: 3

3. **beverage**
   - Number of beverages: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)

4. **dispenser**
   - Number of dispensers: 3

5. **container**
   - Number of containers: 6 (1 shaker + 5 shot glasses)

6. **ingredient**
   - Number of ingredients: 3

7. **cocktail**
   - Number of cocktails: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)

8. **shot**
   - Number of shots: 5 (since shot is a subtype of container, it's already counted in container)

9. **shaker**
   - Number of shakers: 1 (since shaker is a subtype of container, it's already counted in container)

Now let's compile this information into the answer:

Answer:
```json
{
  "hand": 2,
  "level": 3,
  "beverage": 4,
  "dispenser": 3,
  "container": 6,
  "ingredient": 3,
  "cocktail": 4,
  "shot": 5,
  "shaker": 1
}
```

Note: Since "shot" and "shaker" are subtypes of "container," the count for "container" already includes them.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you will now have to extract the names of each object. 

To guide you, we will keep the same example as previously. As a reminder, here it is.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’apple’: [’apple1’, ’apple2’], ’orange’: [], ’plate’: [’plate_1’, ’plate_2’, ’plate_3’, ’plate_4’, ’plate_5’], ’table’: [’table1’, ’table2’], ’ball’: [’ball1’, ’ball3’], ’room’: [’hall’], ’kid’: [], ’robot’: [], ’cell’: [’cell_0_1’, ’cell_0_2’, ’cell_1_1’, ’cell_1_2’, ’cell_2_1’, ’cell_2_2’, ’cell_3_1’, ’cell_3_2’]}

  "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
  "shot": ["shot1", "shot2", "shot3", "shot4", "shot5"],
  "shaker": ["shaker1"]
}
```

--------------------------------------------------

user : Now you have a better understanding of the domain and the problem we have to deal with, you will have to create and think about rules in this domain, that you should follow.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : To create and think about rules in the domain based on the problem, we need to consider the actions and constraints provided by the PDDL domain and the specific goals mentioned in the problem. Here are some rules and guidelines to follow:

### General Rules:

1. **Initial State Constraints:**
   - All shot glasses and the shaker are clean and empty.
   - Both hands (left and right) are empty.
   - All containers (shot glasses and the shaker) are on the table.

   - Each cocktail is composed of specific ingredients (e.g., cocktail1 consists of ingredient2 and ingredient1).

3. **Action-Based Rules:**
   - **Grasp:** A hand can grasp a container only if the container is on the table and the hand is empty.
   - **Leave:** A hand can leave a container on the table only if it is holding the container.
   - **Fill-Shot:** A shot glass can be filled with an ingredient from a dispenser only if the shot glass is empty, clean, and a hand is holding it.
   - **Refill-Shot:** A shot glass can be refilled with an ingredient from a dispenser if it is empty and has been previously used to contain the same ingredient.
   - **Empty-Shot:** A shot glass can be emptied only if it is currently holding a beverage and a hand is holding it.
   - **Clean-Shot:** A shot glass can be cleaned if it is empty and has been previously used.
   - **Pour-Shot-to-Clean-Shaker:** Pouring from a shot glass to a shaker can be done if the shaker is clean, empty, and the shot glass contains an ingredient.
   - **Pour-Shot-to-Used-Shaker:** Pouring from a shot glass to a used shaker can be done if the shaker is unshaked and contains an ingredient.
   - **Empty-Shaker:** A shaker can be emptied if it contains a cocktail, is shaked, and a hand is holding it.
   - **Clean-Shaker:** A shaker can be cleaned if it is empty and a hand is holding it.
   - **Shake:** A shaker can be shaken to create a cocktail if it contains the required ingredients.
   - **Pour-Shaker-to-Shot:** A cocktail can be poured from a shaker to a shot glass if the shot glass is clean and empty.

user : Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

Answer:
(define (problem log_a) 
   (:domain logistics)
   (:objects o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 o7 o8  ;; objects
            tbos tpgh tla            ;; trucks
	         p1 p2                    ;; airplanes

	         lbos lpgh lla            ;; locations
            cpgh cbos cla)           ;; cities
   (:init (object o1) (object o2) (object o3) (object o4)
	  (object o5) (object o6) (object o7) (object o8)
	  (truck tbos) (truck tpgh) (truck tla) (airplane p1)
	  (airplane p2) (vehicle tbos) (vehicle tpgh) (vehicle tla)
	  (vehicle p1) (vehicle p2)
	  (airport abos) (airport apgh) (location abos)
	  (location apgh) (location ala) (location lbos) (location lpgh)
	  (location lla) (city cbos) (city cpgh) (city cla)
	  (loc lpgh cpgh) (loc lbos cbos) (loc lla cla) (loc apgh cpgh)
	  (loc abos cbos) (loc ala cla)
	  (at o1 lpgh) (at o2 lpgh) (at o3 lpgh) (at o4 lpgh) (at o5 lbos)
          (at o6 lbos) (at o7 lbos) (at o8 lla ) (at p1 apgh) (at p2 apgh)
          (at tbos lbos) (at tpgh lpgh) (at tla lla))
   
   (:goal (and (at o1 lbos) (at o2 abos) (at o3 lla) (at o4 ala)
	       (at o5 lpgh) (at o6 apgh) (at o7 lpgh) (at o8 lpgh) (not(at p1 apgh)))) ;(not(at tbos lbos)) was added to give an example of "Not"
   )

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.
- If the domain requires "typing", it is necessary to precise the types of the objects, and if it does not require "typing", you should not put the types, and only write the list of objects.
- Remember that no objects or predicates can simply be named "object".

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2.

user : Your task is to evaluate if a given problem PDDL is correct and accurately corresponds to the natural description of it, as well as using the provided domain PDDL. You will provide feedback based on the following questions. Note that feedback is only required if the problem PDDL does not match the provided description of it. If no feedback is required, you will simply conclude with "No feedback required."
1. Are any necessary objects missing?  
2. Are any unnecessary objects included?  
3. Are any objects defined with the wrong type?  
4. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?  
5. Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?  
6. Is anything missing from the goal description?  
7. Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?  
8. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?
9. Have you used all the predicates from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.
10. Have you used all the object types from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.

Description:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- The airport in Los Angeles has not been declared in the objects, you should declare the object "ala" (at Los Angeles) and you should declare it as an "airport" in the initial conditions as well as a location. 
- The airport at Pittsburgh was declared twice in the initial conditions
- The airport at Pittsburgh (apgh) is wrongly declared at city Los Angeles (cla), and shoudl only be declared at Pittsburgh
- In the goals, there is a mistake about the final location of of package 4 (o4), which should be at Los Angeles airport (ala), and not at Pittsburgh.

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- Only two planes should be declared, not three. Please remove one.
- aphg, corresponding to Pittsburgh airport has not been initialized as an airport, which should be done.
- o6 shoudl be initialized as an object, not as a location.
- The predicate (at p2 ala) is not expected to be in the goal, as it was not demanded in the description of the problem.

Feedback:







--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Let's evaluate the given problem PDDL against the provided description and domain PDDL using the specified questions:

1. **Are any necessary objects missing?**
   - No, all necessary objects are present.

2. **Are any unnecessary objects included?**
   - No, all included objects are necessary.

3. **Are any objects defined with the wrong type?**
   - No, all objects are defined with the correct type.

4. **Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?**
   - No, all predicates declared are necessary and correct.

5. **Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?**
   - No, all necessary predicates for the initial state are included.

6. **Is anything missing from the goal description?**
   - No, the goal description accurately reflects the objectives stated in the problem description.

7. **Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?**
   - No, the goal description does not include any unnecessary predicates.

8. **Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?**
   - No, all predicates are used appropriately without needing symmetry.

9. **Have you used all the predicates from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.**
   - Not all predicates from the domain are used. For example, predicates like `holding`, `used`, `shaked`, `unshaked`, and a few others are not used in the initial state or goal state. These predicates are likely to be used in the actions during the execution of the plan but are not necessary to specify the initial or goal state directly.

10. **Have you used all the object types from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.**
    - All relevant object types from the domain are used. The types `hand`, `level`, `beverage`, `dispenser`, `container`, `ingredient`, `cocktail`, `shot`, and `shaker` are all utilized. The objects correspond accurately to these types.

### Conclusion:

No feedback required.
