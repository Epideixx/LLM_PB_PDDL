system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given a domain PDDL, encoding a environment, I want you to extra some information about the types and the predicates.
Step 1. You will extract all the types, and describe each one of them with a short sentence
Step 2. You will extract the predicates, write the number of arguments each take as well as the types of these arguments. Finally, you will also provide a short description for each of them.

Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain barman)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

This breakdown provides a clear understanding of the types and predicates described in the given PDDL domain.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Using your understanding of the domain, you will now have to understand a problem, formulated in natural language, which is associated with the previous domain PDDL. Your first mission is to collect the number of objects for each type. 

To guide you, I will provide you with an example which belongs to another domain.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’table’: 2, ’apple’: 4, ’orange’: 3, ’plate’: 5, ’ball’: 3, ’kid’: 3, ’cell’: 8}

Now it is your turn, for the following problem:
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2. 

Answer:


--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Based on the given problem, let's extract the number of objects for each type:

1. **shaker**: 1
2. **level**: 3 (associated with the shaker)
3. **shot**: 5 (referred to as "shot glasses")
4. **dispenser**: 3
5. **ingredient**: 3
6. **cocktail**: 4 (cocktail1, cocktail2, cocktail3, cocktail4)
7. **hand**: 2 (left and right hands)

Here is the structured answer:

```json
{
  "shaker": 1,
  "level": 3,
  "shot": 5,
  "dispenser": 3,
  "ingredient": 3,
  "cocktail": 4,
  "hand": 2
}
```

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you will now have to extract the names of each object. 

To guide you, we will keep the same example as previously. As a reminder, here it is.
Text:
You have 2 tables, 5 plates, 4 apples, and 3 balls for 3 kids. apple1 is on plate_2. apple2 is on plate_1. orange1 is on plate_1. orange3 is on plate_2. ball1 is in first drawer of first table. ball3 is in second drawer of first table. apple3 is in first drawer of second table. apple2 is in second drawer of second table. The apples are red. There are three oranges. The plates are clean. The kids are inside the hall. cell_0_1 cell_0_2 cell_1_1 cell_1_2 cell_2_1 cell_2_2 cell_3_1 cell_3_2 There are 8 cells, each cell has a robot. Your goal is to move the oranges to empty plates. orange1 should be on plate_3, orange2 should be on plate_4, orange3 should be on plate_5. No orange should be unplated. The plates are not clean. Each kid should paint a ball. The kids are inside the hall.

Answer:
{’apple’: [’apple1’, ’apple2’], ’orange’: [], ’plate’: [’plate_1’, ’plate_2’, ’plate_3’, ’plate_4’, ’plate_5’], ’table’: [’table1’, ’table2’], ’ball’: [’ball1’, ’ball3’], ’room’: [’hall’], ’kid’: [], ’robot’: [], ’cell’: [’cell_0_1’, ’cell_0_2’, ’cell_1_1’, ’cell_1_2’, ’cell_2_1’, ’cell_2_2’, ’cell_3_1’, ’cell_3_2’]}

Now it is your turn, for our current problem:

  "ingredient": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
  "cocktail": ["cocktail1", "cocktail2", "cocktail3", "cocktail4"],
  "hand": ["left_hand", "right_hand"]
}
```

--------------------------------------------------

user : Now you have a better understanding of the domain and the problem we have to deal with, you will have to create and think about rules in this domain, that you should follow.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Given the domain and the problem, let's outline some rules and constraints that need to be followed. These rules will help us understand how to manipulate the objects and achieve the goals in this domain.

### Basic Rules

1. **Holding and Manipulation:**
   - A hand can only hold one container at a time.
   - A container can only be held by one hand at a time.
   - A hand needs to be empty to pick up a container.
   - Containers need to be placed back on the table if they are no longer being held.

2. **Container States:**
   - Containers can be clean or dirty.
   - Containers can be empty or contain a beverage.
   - Containers need to be cleaned before they can be reused.

3. **Levels and Shakers:**
   - Shakers have levels that indicate the amount or stage of the ingredients inside.
   - Shakers need to be empty and clean before being filled.
   - Shakers can only be shaken if they contain the correct ingredients for a cocktail.

4. **Dispensing and Mixing:**
   - Dispensers provide specific ingredients.
   - Ingredients need to be dispensed into containers before they can be mixed.
   - Mixing ingredients in a shaker produces a cocktail.

### Specific Rules and Constraints

1. **Grasping and Leaving:**
   - To pick up a container from the table, the hand must be empty.
   - To place a container back on the table, the hand must be holding it.

2. **Filling and Refilling Shots:**
   - Shots must be clean and empty before being filled with an ingredient.
   - Shots can be refilled with the same ingredient if they are empty but not clean.

3. **Emptying and Cleaning Shots:**
   - Shots can be emptied if they contain a beverage.
   - Shots need to be cleaned if they have been used.

4. **Pouring Ingredients:**
   - Ingredients can be poured from shots to shakers if the shaker is empty and clean.
   - Pouring ingredients changes the level of the shaker.

5. **Shaking Shakers:**
   - Shakers can only be shaken if they contain the correct ingredients for a specific cocktail.
   - Shaking a shaker will create a cocktail, which will then be contained within the shaker.

6. **Emptying and Cleaning Shakers:**
   - Shakers can be emptied to remove the cocktail.
   - Empty shakers can be cleaned.

7. **Cocktail Mixing:**
   - Each cocktail requires specific ingredients in a specific order.
   - A cocktail is produced by shaking the correct ingredients together.

### Goal Constraints

1. **Cocktail Preparation:**
   - Four specific cocktails need to be prepared.
   - Each cocktail must be placed in a specific shot glass.

2. **Object States for Goals:**
   - Shaker and shot glasses must start clean and empty.
   - Hands must start empty.
   - Ingredients must be dispensed as per the recipe for each cocktail.

### Example Rule Application

To illustrate, let's consider the process of making `cocktail1`:

1. **Grasping:**
   - Use `grasp` action to pick up an empty shot glass with a hand.
   
2. **Filling Shot:**
   - Use `fill-shot` action to fill the shot glass with the correct ingredient from the dispenser.

3. **Pouring to Shaker:**
   - Use `pour-shot-to-clean-shaker` action to pour the ingredient into the shaker.

4. **Shaking:**
   - After adding all required ingredients, use the `shake` action to mix the ingredients into `cocktail1`.

5. **Pouring Cocktail into Shot:**
   - Use `pour-shaker-to-shot` action to pour the prepared cocktail into the shot glass.

By following these rules and constraints, we can create a structured plan to achieve the goals defined in the problem description.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Given the previous information, you now have to explain clearly the initial and goal state. To do so, please follow the next steps.
Step 1. Analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state
Step 2. For each of the states, please write in natural language the connections between the objects. For example if one is on top on the other, or located next to each other, or if an object is free, ...

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Sure, let's break down the initial and goal states based on the given problem. We'll analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state, and then describe them in natural language.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial State and Goal State

**Initial State:**
- Objects: 1 shaker, 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers, 3 ingredients, 2 hands.
- All shot glasses and the shaker are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Both hands (left and right) are empty.
- Dispensers are ready to dispense ingredients.
- There are specific ingredient associations for each cocktail.

**Goal State:**
- The goal is to make 4 specific cocktails.
- Each cocktail should be contained in a specific shot glass.

### Step 2: Describe Initial and Goal State

#### Initial State in Natural Language

1. **Shaker:**
   - There is 1 shaker (`shaker1`) that is clean, empty, and on the table.

2. **Levels:**
   - The shaker has 3 levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`).

3. **Shot Glasses:**
   - There are 5 shot glasses (`shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, `shot5`) that are clean, empty, and on the table.

4. **Dispensers:**
   - There are 3 dispensers (`dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, `dispenser3`) ready to dispense 3 ingredients (`ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `ingredient3`).

5. **Hands:**
   - Both the left hand (`left_hand`) and right hand (`right_hand`) are empty.

6. **Cocktail Ingredient Associations:**
   - `cocktail1` consists of `ingredient2` and `ingredient1`.
   - `cocktail2` consists of `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail3` consists of `ingredient1` and `ingredient3`.
   - `cocktail4` consists of `ingredient3` and `ingredient2`.

#### Goal State in Natural Language

1. **Cocktails in Shot Glasses:**
   - `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
   - `shot2` contains `cocktail4`.
   - `shot3` contains `cocktail3`.
   - `shot4` contains `cocktail2`.

2. **Other States:**
   - The remaining shot glass (`shot5`) is not specified in the goal, so its state is not relevant to the goals.
   - The state of the hands and other objects like dispensers and ingredients is not specified in the goal and thus is not critical to achieving the goals.

### Summary

**Initial State:**
- Shaker, shot glasses, and hands are all clean and empty.
- Dispensers are ready with the ingredients.
- Specific ingredient associations for each cocktail.

**Goal State:**
- Specific cocktails are prepared and placed in specific shot glasses.

By understanding these states in natural language, we can better structure the PDDL problem file to match the desired initial and goal states.

user : Finally, using all the previous information to guide your reflexion, you will have to write the complete problem using the PDDL language. Don't forget anything previously mentioned as it will probably be useful. 

Before you start, here is an example, from another domain.
Example text:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

Answer:
(define (problem log_a) 
   (:domain logistics)
   (:objects o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 o7 o8  ;; objects
            tbos tpgh tla            ;; trucks

            cpgh cbos cla)           ;; cities
   (:init (object o1) (object o2) (object o3) (object o4)
	  (object o5) (object o6) (object o7) (object o8)
	  (truck tbos) (truck tpgh) (truck tla) (airplane p1)
	  (airplane p2) (vehicle tbos) (vehicle tpgh) (vehicle tla)
	  (vehicle p1) (vehicle p2)
	  (airport abos) (airport apgh) (location abos)
	  (location apgh) (location ala) (location lbos) (location lpgh)
	  (location lla) (city cbos) (city cpgh) (city cla)
	  (loc lpgh cpgh) (loc lbos cbos) (loc lla cla) (loc apgh cpgh)
	  (loc abos cbos) (loc ala cla)
	  (at o1 lpgh) (at o2 lpgh) (at o3 lpgh) (at o4 lpgh) (at o5 lbos)
          (at o6 lbos) (at o7 lbos) (at o8 lla ) (at p1 apgh) (at p2 apgh)
          (at tbos lbos) (at tpgh lpgh) (at tla lla))
   
   (:goal (and (at o1 lbos) (at o2 abos) (at o3 lla) (at o4 ala)
	       (at o5 lpgh) (at o6 apgh) (at o7 lpgh) (at o8 lpgh) (not(at p1 apgh)))) ;(not(at tbos lbos)) was added to give an example of "Not"
   )

Before you start, here are also some rules you need to know:
- The objects cannot be number, like you cannot write 1 or 3 alone. So replace them by h1 and h3 instead or any other notation corresponing to the situation.
- If the domain requires "typing", it is necessary to precise the types of the objects, and if it does not require "typing", you should not put the types, and only write the list of objects.
- Remember that no objects or predicates can simply be named "object".

Now, it is your turn to translate the text into proper PDDL. 
Text:
You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail4 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 4 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail4. shot3 contains cocktail3. shot4 contains cocktail2.

    )
  )
)
```

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** The objects are listed with their respective types as required by the domain.
- **Initial State:** The initial state describes the cleanliness, emptiness, and location (on the table) of the shaker and shot glasses. It also includes the state of the hands (empty) and the associations between dispensers and ingredients.
- **Cocktail Ingredients:** The `cocktail-part1` and `cocktail-part2` predicates specify the ingredients required for each cocktail.
- **Goal State:** The goal state specifies that each shot glass should contain the respective cocktail.

This PDDL problem specification matches the provided natural language problem description and adheres to the rules and constraints of the domain.

--------------------------------------------------

user : Your task is to evaluate if a given problem PDDL is correct and accurately corresponds to the natural description of it, as well as using the provided domain PDDL. You will provide feedback based on the following questions. Note that feedback is only required if the problem PDDL does not match the provided description of it. If no feedback is required, you will simply conclude with "No feedback required."
1. Are any necessary objects missing?  
2. Are any unnecessary objects included?  
3. Are any objects defined with the wrong type?  
4. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?  
5. Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?  
6. Is anything missing from the goal description?  
7. Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?  
8. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?
9. Have you used all the predicates from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.
10. Have you used all the object types from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.

To help you better understand what is expected from you, here are three examples. Those are all based on the same domain PDDL and on the same description.

Description:
This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.

   )

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- The airport in Los Angeles has not been declared in the objects, you should declare the object "ala" (at Los Angeles) and you should declare it as an "airport" in the initial conditions as well as a location. 
- The airport at Pittsburgh was declared twice in the initial conditions
- The airport at Pittsburgh (apgh) is wrongly declared at city Los Angeles (cla), and shoudl only be declared at Pittsburgh
- In the goals, there is a mistake about the final location of of package 4 (o4), which should be at Los Angeles airport (ala), and not at Pittsburgh.

Feedback:
Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:
- Only two planes should be declared, not three. Please remove one.
- aphg, corresponding to Pittsburgh airport has not been initialized as an airport, which should be done.
- o6 shoudl be initialized as an object, not as a location.
- The predicate (at p2 ala) is not expected to be in the goal, as it was not demanded in the description of the problem.

Feedback:







--------------------------------------------------

assistant : Here is a full feedback based on the questions and the provided description:

1. **Are any necessary objects missing?**
   - No missing objects. All required objects (shaker, levels, shots, dispensers, ingredients, cocktails, and hands) are included.

2. **Are any unnecessary objects included?**
   - No unnecessary objects are included.

3. **Are any objects defined with the wrong type?**
   - No objects are defined with the wrong type.

4. **Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates declared?**
   - No unnecessary or incorrect predicates are declared.

5. **Are any necessary predicates missing from the initial state?**
   - The initial state predicates cover the cleanliness, emptiness, and location (on the table) of the shaker and shot glasses, as well as the state of the hands and the associations between dispensers and ingredients. No necessary predicates are missing.

6. **Is anything missing from the goal description?**
   - No, the goal description accurately specifies that each shot glass should contain the respective cocktail.

7. **Is anything unnecessary included in the goal description?**
   - No unnecessary predicates are included in the goal description.

8. **Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?**
   - No symmetrical predicates are necessary in this context.

9. **Have you used all the predicates from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.**
   - Not all predicates from the domain are used. For example, predicates like `used`, `shaked`, `unshaked`, `shaker-empty-level`, and `next` are not directly used. These predicates are not necessary for the given problem's initial state or goal state as specified in the natural language description.

10. **Have you used all the object types from the domain or left some? Explain your choice.**
    - All relevant object types (hand, level, beverage, dispenser, container, ingredient, cocktail, shot, and shaker) are used. The types not used (if any) are not relevant to the specific problem description provided.

**Conclusion:**
No feedback required.
