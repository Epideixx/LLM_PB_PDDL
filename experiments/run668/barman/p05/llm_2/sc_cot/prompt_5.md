Sure, let's break down the initial and goal states based on the given problem. We'll analyze what belongs to the initial state and what belongs to the goal state, and then describe them in natural language.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial State and Goal State

**Initial State:**
- Objects: 1 shaker, 3 levels, 5 shot glasses, 3 dispensers, 3 ingredients, 2 hands.
- All shot glasses and the shaker are clean, empty, and on the table.
- Both hands (left and right) are empty.
- Dispensers are ready to dispense ingredients.
- There are specific ingredient associations for each cocktail.

**Goal State:**
- The goal is to make 4 specific cocktails.
- Each cocktail should be contained in a specific shot glass.

### Step 2: Describe Initial and Goal State

#### Initial State in Natural Language

1. **Shaker:**
   - There is 1 shaker (`shaker1`) that is clean, empty, and on the table.

2. **Levels:**
   - The shaker has 3 levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`).

3. **Shot Glasses:**
   - There are 5 shot glasses (`shot1`, `shot2`, `shot3`, `shot4`, `shot5`) that are clean, empty, and on the table.

4. **Dispensers:**
   - There are 3 dispensers (`dispenser1`, `dispenser2`, `dispenser3`) ready to dispense 3 ingredients (`ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `ingredient3`).

5. **Hands:**
   - Both the left hand (`left_hand`) and right hand (`right_hand`) are empty.

6. **Cocktail Ingredient Associations:**
   - `cocktail1` consists of `ingredient2` and `ingredient1`.
   - `cocktail2` consists of `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`.
   - `cocktail3` consists of `ingredient1` and `ingredient3`.
   - `cocktail4` consists of `ingredient3` and `ingredient2`.

#### Goal State in Natural Language

1. **Cocktails in Shot Glasses:**
   - `shot1` contains `cocktail1`.
   - `shot2` contains `cocktail4`.
   - `shot3` contains `cocktail3`.
   - `shot4` contains `cocktail2`.

2. **Other States:**
   - The remaining shot glass (`shot5`) is not specified in the goal, so its state is not relevant to the goals.
   - The state of the hands and other objects like dispensers and ingredients is not specified in the goal and thus is not critical to achieving the goals.

### Summary

**Initial State:**
- Shaker, shot glasses, and hands are all clean and empty.
- Dispensers are ready with the ingredients.
- Specific ingredient associations for each cocktail.

**Goal State:**
- Specific cocktails are prepared and placed in specific shot glasses.

By understanding these states in natural language, we can better structure the PDDL problem file to match the desired initial and goal states.
