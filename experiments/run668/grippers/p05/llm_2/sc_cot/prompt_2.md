Given the problem statement, I will extract the number of objects for each type based on the domain PDDL provided earlier.

### Extraction of Objects for Each Type
- **robot**: 2 (You control 2 robots)
- **gripper**: 4 (Each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper, so 2 robots * 2 grippers = 4 grippers)
- **room**: 2 (There are 2 rooms)
- **ball (object)**: 5 (There are 5 balls)

### Compiled Answer
```json
{
  "robot": 2,
  "gripper": 4,
  "room": 2,
  "object": 5
}
```

This extraction accurately reflects the quantities of each type of object mentioned in the problem description. If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!
