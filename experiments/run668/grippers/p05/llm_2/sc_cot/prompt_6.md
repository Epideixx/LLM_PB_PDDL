### Explanation

#### Objects
- **Robots**: `robot1`, `robot2`
- **Grippers**: `left_gripper1`, `right_gripper1`, `left_gripper2`, `right_gripper2`
- **Rooms**: `room1`, `room2`
- **Balls**: `ball1`, `ball2`, `ball3`, `ball4`, `ball5`

#### Initial State
- **Robot Locations**:
  - `robot2` is in `room1`.
  - `robot1` is in `room2`.
- **Ball Locations**:
  - `ball2`, `ball5`, `ball1`, `ball3`, and `ball4` are all in `room1`.
- **Gripper Status**:
  - All grippers of both robots are free (`left_gripper1`, `right_gripper1`, `left_gripper2`, `right_gripper2`).

#### Goal State
- The ball `ball1` should be in `room1`.
- The ball `ball2` should be in `room1`.
- The ball `ball3` should be in `room2`.
- The ball `ball4` should be in `room1`.
- The ball `ball5` should be in `room1`.
