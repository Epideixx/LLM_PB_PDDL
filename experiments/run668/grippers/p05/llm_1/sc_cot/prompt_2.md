Based on the provided problem description, we need to identify the number of objects for each type. Here is the information extracted from the text:

### Objects Count
1. **robots**: 2
2. **grippers**: 4 (each robot has a left and a right gripper, so 2 robots * 2 grippers each)
3. **rooms**: 2
4. **balls (objects)**: 5

Here is the answer formatted:

```json
{
  "robot": 2,
  "gripper": 4,
  "room": 2,
  "object": 5
}
```

This breakdown should match the types defined in the domain PDDL and help in understanding the problem scenario in terms of the given domain. If you need further assistance or additional information, feel free to ask!
