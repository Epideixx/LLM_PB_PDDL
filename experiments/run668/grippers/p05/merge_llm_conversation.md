system : You are a computer scientist specialised in PDDL formulation who will help me doing translation between natural language and Problem PDDL.

--------------------------------------------------

user : As expert in PDDL, your mission is to return the final translation from a problem formulated in natural language to a Problem PDDL. To do so, you will be given the domain PDDL, the original description of the task that you have to translate, as well as multiple potential versions of this translation. Your goal is then to combine them in a smart way. Before outputting the final PDDL translation, you will think and explain your reasoning.
 The final translation will be between 'START TRANSLATION' and 'END TRANSLATION'. Here is the domain PDDL:
(define (domain gripper-strips)
 (:requirements :strips :typing) 
 (:types room robot gripper - object) ;Add the modify object to "- object" else issue parser
 (:predicates (at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room)
 	      (at ?o - object ?x - room)
	      (free ?r - robot ?g - gripper)
	      (carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper))

   (:action move
       :parameters  (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
       :precondition (and  (at-robby ?r ?from))
       :effect (and  (at-robby ?r ?to)
		     (not (at-robby ?r ?from))))

   (:action pick
       :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
       :precondition  (and  (at ?obj ?room) (at-robby ?r ?room) (free ?r ?g))
       :effect (and (carry ?r ?obj ?g)
		    (not (at ?obj ?room)) 
		    (not (free ?r ?g))))

   (:action drop
       :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
       :precondition  (and  (carry ?r ?obj ?g) (at-robby ?r ?room))
       :effect (and (at ?obj ?room)
		    (free ?r ?g)
		    (not (carry ?r ?obj ?g)))))

And this is the description of the task we aim to translate:
You control 2 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 2 rooms and 5 balls. 
robot2 is in room1. robot1 is in room2. 
ball2 is in room1. ball5 is in room1. ball1 is in room1. ball3 is in room1. ball4 is in room1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room1. 
ball2 should be in room1. 
ball3 should be in room2. 
ball4 should be in room1. 
ball5 should be in room1. 


Finally, to help you, we generated potential translations of this task:
Potential translation 1:
(define (problem transport_balls)
  (:domain gripper-strips)

    robot1 robot2 - robot
    left_gripper_robot1 right_gripper_robot1 left_gripper_robot2 right_gripper_robot2 - gripper
    room1 room2 - room
    ball1 ball2 ball3 ball4 ball5 - object
  )

  (:init 
    ;; Robot locations
    (at-robby robot1 room2)
    (at-robby robot2 room1)
    
    ;; Ball locations
    (at ball1 room1)
    (at ball2 room1)
    (at ball3 room1)
    (at ball4 room1)
    (at ball5 room1)
    
    ;; Gripper status

      (at ball4 room1)
      (at ball5 room1)
    )
  )
)


Potential translation 2:
(define (problem gripper-problem)
  (:domain gripper-strips)
  (:objects

    (free robot1 right_gripper1)
    (free robot2 left_gripper2)
    (free robot2 right_gripper2)
  )

      (at ball3 room2)
      (at ball4 room1)
      (at ball5 room1)
    )
  )
)


Please make the best out of these translations to generate the final PDDL translation.

--------------------------------------------------

assistant : To generate the final PDDL translation, let's analyze the given potential translations and the task description to ensure all details are correctly captured.

### Task Description Analysis:
1. **Robots and Grippers:**
   - 2 robots: `robot1` and `robot2`.
   - Each robot has a left and right gripper.

2. **Rooms:**
   - 2 rooms: `room1` and `room2`.

3. **Balls:**
   - 5 balls: `ball1`, `ball2`, `ball3`, `ball4`, and `ball5`.

4. **Initial Locations:**
   - `robot1` is in `room2`.
   - `robot2` is in `room1`.
   - All balls (`ball1`, `ball2`, `ball3`, `ball4`, `ball5`) are in `room1`.

5. **Gripper Status:**
   - All grippers are free.

6. **Goals:**
   - `ball1` should be in `room1`.
   - `ball2` should be in `room1`.
   - `ball3` should be in `room2`.
   - `ball4` should be in `room1`.
   - `ball5` should be in `room1`.

### Comparison of Potential Translations:
Both translations are quite similar, but there are minor differences in naming conventions for grippers and the order of ball locations. We need to ensure consistency and correctness.

### Final Translation:
1. **Problem Name:**
   - Use a consistent and descriptive name, e.g., `transport_balls`.

2. **Domain:**
   - Use the provided domain `gripper-strips`.

3. **Objects:**
   - Ensure all objects (robots, grippers, rooms, balls) are correctly defined.

4. **Initial State:**
   - Ensure the initial locations of robots and balls are correctly specified.
   - Ensure all grippers are marked as free.

5. **Goal State:**
   - Ensure the goal locations for all balls are correctly specified.

Combining the best elements from both potential translations, we get:

```lisp
(define (problem transport_balls)
  (:domain gripper-strips)
  (:objects 
    robot1 robot2 - robot
    left_gripper_robot1 right_gripper_robot1 left_gripper_robot2 right_gripper_robot2 - gripper
    room1 room2 - room
    ball1 ball2 ball3 ball4 ball5 - object
  )

  (:init 
    ;; Robot locations
    (at-robby robot1 room2)
    (at-robby robot2 room1)
    
    ;; Ball locations
    (at ball1 room1)
    (at ball2 room1)
    (at ball3 room1)
    (at ball4 room1)
    (at ball5 room1)
    
    ;; Gripper status
    (free robot1 left_gripper_robot1)
    (free robot1 right_gripper_robot1)
    (free robot2 left_gripper_robot2)
    (free robot2 right_gripper_robot2)
  )

  (:goal 
    (and 
      ;; Goal ball locations
      (at ball1 room1)
      (at ball2 room1)
      (at ball3 room2)
      (at ball4 room1)
      (at ball5 room1)
    )
  )
)
```

### Reasoning:
- **Problem Name:** `transport_balls` is descriptive and aligns with the task.
- **Domain:** `gripper-strips` is used as specified.
- **Objects:** All robots, grippers, rooms, and balls are correctly defined.
- **Initial State:** The initial locations of robots and balls are correctly specified, and all grippers are marked as free.
- **Goal State:** The goal locations for all balls are correctly specified.

This final translation ensures all details from the task description are accurately captured and represented in the PDDL problem definition.
