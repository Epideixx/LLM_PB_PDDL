Let's break down the initial and goal states according to the given problem description.

### Step 1: Analyze Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:
- The robot starts at position `pos-1-0`.
- The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-1-0`.
- The maximum height of blocks is 4.
- The initial heights at all positions are not explicitly given, but it is implied that they are likely to be 0 or some default value.
- The robot is not holding any blocks at the beginning.

#### Goal State:
- The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.
- The heights at other positions should remain unchanged (implied to stay at their initial values).
- The robot should not be holding any unplaced blocks at the end.

### Step 2: Natural Language Description of Initial and Goal States

#### Initial State:
1. **Robot Location**:
   - The robot is at position `pos-1-0`.

2. **Depot Location**:
   - The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-1-0`.

3. **Heights at Positions**:
   - The heights at all positions are initially 0.
     - `pos-0-0` height is 0.
     - `pos-0-1` height is 0.
     - `pos-0-2` height is 0.
     - `pos-1-0` height is 0.
     - `pos-1-1` height is 0.
     - `pos-1-2` height is 0.
     - `pos-2-0` height is 0.
     - `pos-2-1` height is 0.
     - `pos-2-2` height is 0.
     - `pos-3-0` height is 0.
     - `pos-3-1` height is 0.
     - `pos-3-2` height is 0.

4. **Robot Holding Block**:
   - The robot is not holding any blocks.

#### Goal State:
1. **Heights at Specific Positions**:
   - The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
   - The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.

2. **Heights at Other Positions**:
   - The heights at all other positions should remain unchanged.
     - Heights at `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1` should stay at their initial values (implied to be 0).

3. **Robot Holding Block**:
   - The robot should not be holding any unplaced blocks at the end.

### Summary in Natural Language:

#### Initial State:
- The robot is at position `pos-1-0`.
- The depot for new blocks is at position `pos-1-0`.
- All positions on the grid start with a height of 0.
- The robot is not holding a block.

#### Goal State:
- The height at position `pos-2-0` should be 3.
- The height at position `pos-3-2` should be 4.
- The heights at all other positions should remain at 0.
- The robot should not be holding any unplaced blocks.

This breakdown provides a clear picture of both the initial and goal states, as well as the relationships and conditions that must be satisfied.
