Sure, let's consider the rules that are implied by the domain and problem description. These rules will guide the actions that can be taken and the conditions under which they can be executed.

### Implied Rules:
1. **Movement Rules**:
   - The robot can only move to neighboring positions.
   - A position is considered a neighbor if it is directly adjacent horizontally or vertically.
   - The robot must be at a position to move from it.
   - The robot cannot move to a position if the height at both the current and target positions is not equal, unless moving up or down.

2. **Height Rules**:
   - Heights at positions can range from 0 to 4.
   - The height at a position can only be increased by placing a block.
   - The height at a position can only be decreased by removing a block.
   - Heights at specific positions must meet the target heights specified in the goal state.

3. **Block Rules**:
   - Blocks can only be created or destroyed at depot positions.
   - The robot must be at a depot to create or destroy blocks.
   - A block must be placed to increase the height at a position.
   - A block must be removed to decrease the height at a position.
   - The robot can only hold one block at a time.
   - At the end, the robot should not be holding any unplaced blocks.

4. **Position Rules**:
   - The robot starts at a specific position (pos-1-0).
   - The depot for new blocks is also at a specific position (pos-1-0).

### Rules to Follow:
1. **Movement**:
   - `(move ?from ?to ?h)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?from`.
     - `?from` and `?to` are neighbors.
     - The height at `?from` is `?h`.
     - The height at `?to` is `?h`.
   - `(move-up ?from ?hfrom ?to ?hto)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?from`.
     - `?from` and `?to` are neighbors.
     - The height at `?from` is `?hfrom`.
     - The height at `?to` is `?hto`.
     - `?hto` is the successor of `?hfrom`.
   - `(move-down ?from ?hfrom ?to ?hto)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?from`.
     - `?from` and `?to` are neighbors.
     - The height at `?from` is `?hfrom`.
     - The height at `?to` is `?hto`.
     - `?hfrom` is the successor of `?hto`.

2. **Block Manipulation**:
   - `(place-block ?rpos ?bpos ?hbefore ?hafter)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?rpos`.
     - `?rpos` and `?bpos` are neighbors.
     - The height at `?rpos` is `?hbefore`.
     - The height at `?bpos` is `?hbefore`.
     - `?hafter` is the successor of `?hbefore`.
     - The robot is holding a block.
     - `?bpos` is not a depot.
   - `(remove-block ?rpos ?bpos ?hbefore ?hafter)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?rpos`.
     - `?rpos` and `?bpos` are neighbors.
     - The height at `?rpos` is `?hafter`.
     - The height at `?bpos` is `?hbefore`.
     - `?hbefore` is the successor of `?hafter`.
     - The robot is not holding a block.
   - `(create-block ?p)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?p`.
     - The robot is not holding a block.
     - `?p` is a depot.
   - `(destroy-block ?p)` action can only be executed if:
     - The robot is at `?p`.
     - The robot is holding a block.
     - `?p` is a depot.

3. **Goal Achievement**:
   - The heights at `pos-2-0` and `pos-3-2` must be 3 and 4, respectively, by the end.
   - The heights at other positions must remain unchanged.
   - The robot should not be holding any unplaced blocks at the end.

These rules should be followed to ensure that the actions taken are valid and the goals are achieved as specified.
