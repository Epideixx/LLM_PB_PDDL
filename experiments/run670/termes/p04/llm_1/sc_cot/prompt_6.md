### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Includes all the positions and numeric heights (`h0` to `h4`) with their respective types.
- **Initial State**: Specifies the initial conditions:
  - The robot starts at `pos-1-0`.
  - The depot for new blocks is at `pos-1-0`.
  - The initial heights at all positions are set to `h0` (which represents 0).
  - Successor relationships between heights are defined using `SUCC` predicate.
  - Neighbor relationships between positions are defined using `NEIGHBOR` predicate.
- **Goal State**: Specifies the desired conditions:
  - The height at `pos-2-0` should be `h3` (which represents 3).
  - The height at `pos-3-2` should be `h4` (which represents 4).
  - The heights at all other positions should remain `h0`.
  - The robot should not be holding any unplaced blocks (`not (has-block)`).

This PDDL problem definition adheres to the rules and constraints specified in the domain and problem descriptions.
