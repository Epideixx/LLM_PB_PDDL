Based on the provided problem description, we need to identify the number of objects for each type defined in the domain PDDL: `numb` and `position`.

### Extracting Objects

**Positions:**
- The grid has 4 rows and 3 columns, resulting in 12 unique positions.
  - Positions: `pos-0-0`, `pos-0-1`, `pos-0-2`, `pos-1-0`, `pos-1-1`, `pos-1-2`, `pos-2-0`, `pos-2-1`, `pos-2-2`, `pos-3-0`, `pos-3-1`, `pos-3-2`

**Numbers:**
- The maximum height of blocks is 4, which means the numerical values we need are from 1 to 4.
  - Numbers: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`

### Result

Answer:
```json
{
  "position": 12,
  "numb": 4
}
```

This indicates that there are 12 positions and 4 numerical values available in the problem.
