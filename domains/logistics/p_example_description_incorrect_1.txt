This PDDL problem describes a logistics scenario with the following elements and goals:

Objects and Locations:
- 7 objects (o1 to o7)
- 3 trucks (tbos, tpgh, tla)
- 2 airplanes (p1, p2)
- 3 airports (abos, apgh, ala)
- 3 locations (lbos, lpgh, lla)
- 3 cities (cpgh, cbos, cla)

Initial State:
- Objects o1, o2, o3, and o4 are at location lpgh (in Pittsburgh)
- Objects o5 and o6 are at location lbos (in Boston)
- Object o7 is at location lla (in Los Angeles)
- Both airplanes (p1 and p2) are at airport abos (Boston airport)
- Truck tbos is at location lbos (in Boston)
- Truck tpgh is at location lpgh (in Pittsburgh)
- Truck tla is at location lla (in Los Angeles)

Goal State:
The goal is to move the objects to the following locations:
1. Object o1 to location lbos (Boston)
2. Object o2 to airport abos (Boston airport)
3. Object o3 to location lla (Los Angeles)
4. Object o4 to airport ala (Los Angeles airport)
5. Object o5 to location lpgh (Pittsburgh)
6. Object o6 to airport apgh (Pittsburgh airport)
7. Object o7 to location lpgh (Pittsburgh)
8. Airplane p2 should not be at airport apgh (Pittsburgh airport)

The problem involves coordinating the movement of objects between different cities using trucks for local transport and airplanes for inter-city transport to achieve the specified goal state.
