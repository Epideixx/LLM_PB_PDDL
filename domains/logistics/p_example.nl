This logistics problem involves three cities: Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
Each city has an airport and another location. 
There are 8 packages, 3 trucks (one in each city), and 2 airplanes (both initially in Pittsburgh) to be used for transportation. 

At the start, four packages (o1, o2, o3, o4) are in Pittsburgh, three (o5, o6, o7) are in Boston, and one (o8) is in Los Angeles. 

The goal is to redistribute these packages: o1 should end up at a location in Boston, o2 at Boston's airport, o3 at a location in Los Angeles, o4 at Los Angeles' airport, o5 and o7 at a location in Pittsburgh, o6 at Pittsburgh's airport, and o8 should be moved from Los Angeles to a location in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the first plane should not be in Pittsburgh anymore at the end.
